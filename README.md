This repository accompanies the MA thesis
"Sensing a Vibe: Facilitating Serendipitous Discovery and Engagement for Casual Users via Digital Exploration through Internet Aesthetics. An Artpedia Case Study."
by Sofiya Rangelova, University of Amsterdam, 2025.

# Overview
This project examines how organizing digital cultural heritage collections by internet aesthetics, utilizing a searchless, visually organized interface, can enhance user engagement and facilitate serendipitous discovery for casual users. 

The repository contains:

The codebook used for manual annotation, compiled using the scraped Internet Aesthetics from the Aesthetics Fandom Wiki that can be accessed [here]/https://aesthetics.fandom.com/wiki/Category:Internet_Aesthetics 

The code (Jupyter notebook) used for data processing and automated classification experiments with large language models (LLMs).

The compiled dataset of internet aesthetics (IA) categories, scraped and curated from the Aesthetics Wiki, as used for classification and annotation tasks in the thesis.

The primary art dataset (Artpedia) used for annotation and experimentation is publicly available [here]\(https://aimagelab.ing.unimore.it/imagelab/page.asp?IdPage=35) and is not redistributed in this repository.

How to Use
Clone the repository

text
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/sensing-a-vibe.git

Install dependencies
The notebook uses Python 3.x and standard data science libraries (see the first cell of the notebook for details).
For LLM experiments, you will need an OpenAI API key.

Access the Artpedia dataset
Download the Artpedia dataset from its official repository and place it in your working directory if you wish to replicate the full experiments.

Run the notebook
