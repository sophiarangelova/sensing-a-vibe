2014 Girly,https://aesthetics.fandom.com/wiki/2014_Girly,"2014 Girly Tumblr is an aesthetic seen in 2014 Tumblr. It centers itself around visuals that girly Tumblr bloggers found popular at the time. It embraces girly traits and colors, such as pale pink, white and mint, as well as brands, celebrities, room decor trends, foods, etc. that would be aspirational and overtly feminine.
The aesthetic has resurfaced on social media app TikTok in around Summer 2024, likely due to users longing for its energy it gave.",2012-2016,,,"Various shades of pink, cream white, beige, and mint",
2014 Tumblr,https://aesthetics.fandom.com/wiki/2014_Tumblr,"2014 Tumblr is one of the biggest influences to the contemporary aesthetics movement. As an image-aggregating site, it allowed people to curate personal reblogs easily. The ability to create a customized theme for the blog also enhanced the aesthetic value of the website. This article focuses on 2014 (more broadly 2011–2018) because this was the era before -core suffixes existed, Tumblr was at its greatest cultural relevancy, and the aesthetic trend was at its infancy.",Mid 2010s,,,,
After Hours,https://aesthetics.fandom.com/wiki/After_Hours,"After Hours is an aesthetic inspired by the forlorn atmosphere of empty or seemingly abandoned places that are usually bustling with people.  After Hours isn’t defined in terms of a specific artstyle or media, but instead by the imagery of various abandoned places such as empty streets, schools, and parks. However, the aesthetic is not limited to physical settings either; online settings such as abandoned blogs, empty game servers, and inactive websites can also elicit similar feelings.
The concept is built on the contrast between the memories or expectations associated with a place and the current reality of it being abandoned or devoid of human presence. These feelings, which have collectively been coined as kenopsia, include a mix of nostalgia, melancholy, and a sense of surrealism. The emptiness of the abandoned space and the remains of its former vitality can create a powerful emotional response. For some, it might cause them to reflect on the passage of time, the transience of life, or the impermanence of human activities. The always-present tranquility of After Hours distinguishes it from the adjacent aesthetic of Liminal Space, which is intentionally designed to be unsettling and foreboding.[1]
Several people who identify with this aesthetic like to explore such places, while others - such as graveyard shift workers - have no option but to be active during night. These night-crawlers love silence and quiet settings. Being away from everyone and everything is comforting to them.
The aesthetic is commonly seen in Post-Apocalyptic media to convey the effects of the world becoming empty.
Sometime about March 29th, 2015, John Koenig coined kenopsia for his online project, The Dictionary of Obscure Sorrows.[2][3][4][5]
Visuals for After Hours tend to be dimly lit public areas usually bustling with people, but are shown as empty. Photos usually have streetlights that are on 24/7 as the rest of the street is dark and lifeless. Unlike the Liminal Space aesthetic, these empty areas are not always intended to be unsettling; rather, they are supposed to invoke a feeling of rebelliousness and tranquility. To people that participate in this aesthetic, the late hours are mysterious and contemplative, a moment filled with the imagery of light poles, shady corners, clocks, trash blowing, quiet urban scenery, wanderers and cat's eyes lurking.
The visuals associated often convey a haunting and surreal atmosphere. When exploring abandoned or empty spaces or locations, certain visual elements tend to be highlighted. These visual elements can include decay, emptiness, silence, nostalgia, and stillness. Often these evoke feelings of despair or uneasiness. Anything with these characteristics is usually identified as evoking kenopsia. Often these things are also related to liminal spaces, so there is crossover in that regard.

After Hours activities usually involve interacting with empty public areas; whether it be traveling through or waiting for someone that may never come. Some activities related to After Hours are illegal or dangerous and will vary according to the urban area where it takes place.
These include:
Kenopsia has inspired various forms of media, including photography, literature, film, and art, where creators capture and convey the unique atmosphere associated with abandoned or desolate spaces. Some examples that utilize kenopsia include:
As an aesthetic based heavily on ambient, ambient-based, and adjacent music genres can be seen as complementary to this aesthetic. There are many ways one can communicate the feeling of kenopsia and some do through music by evoking feelings of emptiness, nostalgia, or solitude, similar associated things.",2010s,"Nighthawks, Edward Hopper","Darkness, emptiness, familiarity, tranquility, melancholy","Darker colors due to shadows, Gold, Yellow",
Angelcore,https://aesthetics.fandom.com/wiki/Angelcore,"Before the aesthetic community largely segmented itself off into aesthetic communities, people would ""find"" their aesthetic through tags which were based on adjectives and objects that described the photograph itself, rather than an entire community that comes with it. Of course, there are common terms that appeared, such as kawaii, hipster, and grunge, but the extent was not to the one in the late 2010s-2020s. From there, communities were centered around who was following who, without an established name that encompassed all the community. ""
""""And everyday / I am learning about you / The things that no one else sees / And the end comes too soon / Like dreaming of angels"""" -The XX, """"Angels""""

Angelcore is a contemporary aesthetic inspired by imagery and depictions of angels, and is the opposite adjacent aesthetic to Devilcore. It has an Ethereal vibe and is inspired by the Rococo era artwork; many of the old paintings with cherubs you find on Pinterest are Rococo.
The aesthetic is designed to emulate the same unearthly beauty that the European stereotype of angels are described and depicted with, though it can also include non-European angel aesthetics. This can be done with modern or older presentation methods.
It’s also worth noting that much of the angel mythology and imagery comes from multiple belief systems (from Greek paganism, to Judaism, to New Age, to the aforementioned Christianity). So there are no specific religious connections or connotations involved in an angelic aesthetic.
There is also an entirely Angelcore store in the Montmartre district of Paris, called La Boutique des Anges, Rue Yvonne le Tac no. 2. There are all kinds of designs with angels, mainly figures.
As an aesthetic based heavily on feeling, ambient-based and adjacent music genres can be seen as complementary to this aesthetic. Folk and classic piano are also popular.

The difference between cherubs (aka putti, singular putto) and angels are enough to warrant its own tag on various social media websites most notably Tumblr. Cherubcore focuses on the feelings and values portrayed by heavenly cherubs and the small, sweet, baby-like innocence of the figures that differ from the divine essence of angels. There is often a distinct crossover in this aesthetic with Babycore and Delicate Sweet, with a hint of Lovecore now and then due to the similarity between cherubs and the mythical figure Cupid. The visuals of cherubcore are the same as angelcore but add more fun visuals like candy, cherubs laughing in paintings, hearts, porcelain figures, and child's toys. There are lots of pinks and whites involved as well. Fashion has a very similar overlap to Coquette(especially gloomy coquette), and Babycore, with youthful and childlike articles of clothing and accessories. It is worth mentioning that the baby angels portrayed as cherubs in art and in this aesthetic are based off of ancient Greaco-Roman putti associated with the god Eros/Cupid, and not on the actual biblical portrayal of cherubs which is vastly different.

The Fallen Angel aesthetic, also known as dark/goth angelcore, takes angelcore and adds more somber themes and dark visual tones while still providing the essences of ethereal and other-worldy, similar to Dethereal. Many of the themes of fallen angel involve feelings of """"falling from grace"""" or unworthiness/not wanting to be placed on a pedestal like angels are commonly portrayed. The aesthetic itself can both exude feelings of peace and radiance or sorrow and malice depending on the camp presented. It is closely related to Devilcore and may even be considered the same thing.
Common motifs for fallen angels include angel statues, black wings, flowing white and/or black fabrics, fire, halos, horns and tails, the sky and the ground, snakes, and much more. Visually, there is a crossover with Dark Naturalism, which exhibits dark, misty visuals of nature. Other visuals can overlap with Traumacore and Grunge, employing angelic motifs mixed with heavy melancholy themes. Fashion takes regular angelcore and turns it black, almost Gothic. It can also take an aforementioned Grunge route. Baroque art may be seen as well, which has a darker tone than Rococo.
This aesthetic can focus on criticizing the Catholic religion, sharing similar aspects of reasoning with Sacricore. Common topics include excommunication, religious trauma, and mental illness. Often this is mixed with the aforementioned feelings of falling from grace or feeling tainted, and potentially being cast out of a religion or choosing to leave it.
Biblical Angels are taken from the biblical depiction of angels, rather than the altered humanistic version created by the media. There are various sections of the Bible where angels and cherubs are described, including Ezekiel 1:5-11, Isaiah 6:2, Job 38:7, Ps 8:5, Ac 26:13, and Re 1:20. These verses and many others describe angels as hot, pure energy, and frightening to humans. This is a popular subject in art and can be seen across media. Often times they are depicted as half human, half animal or as energy balls with a thousand eyes circling around it with six wings.
This subject focuses on the reality of divinity and the terrifying truth that had been covered up by mainstream society over history. The overall theme of the biblical angel aesthetic is questioning monstrosity and fear, and presenting truth to those living in ignorance. It is both ethereal and horrifying, and has a subcommunity for those who identify with these depictions. These communities also use their art of biblical angels to portray the previously mention themes, as well as humor. Being ethereal and mysterious, feeling """"too big your body"""", and a deep philosophical nature can accompany the moods of this aesthetic.""",2010s,"The Toilette of Venus, by François Boucher, 1751, oil on canvas; Les Génies des Arts, by François Boucher, 1761, oil on canvas; Fallen Angel, by Alexandre Cabanel, 1847, oil on canvas","Angels, cherubs, wings, doves, halos, softness, purity, metallic shimmer","White, gold, light blue, light yellow, light pink",
Anime New Moon,https://aesthetics.fandom.com/wiki/Anime_New_Moon,"Anime New Moon is an aesthetic based on a particular type of anime graphic design that was very prevalent during the mid-2000s to early 2010s and was often featured in the videos of Nightcore remixes of that time involving Trance music. Visually, it could be described as elegant, ethereal and slightly mysterious. Artworks relating to this aesthetic typically involve the night and other elements relating to it, like the moon, stars, moonlight, galaxies, etc., as well as mythological creatures relating to angels or vampires. It is a sister aesthetic of Technoneko2000, as both have influenced Nightcore as a whole.
The visuals found in the Anime New Moon aesthetic are all about nighttime and ethereal elements. The color palette of the aesthetic often uses multiple shades of blue (from pastel to navy), white, purple and pink. For instance, PicsArt, a popular image editing app, has an image filter called ""Nightcore""[1], which also uses this specific color palette associated with the Anime New Moon aesthetic. The aesthetic focuses on beautiful aspects of the night, like the moon, moonlight and stars, as well as other elements like galaxies or waterfalls. The characters featured in the images and edits are typically fantastic characters, like angels, vampires or magical girls. Other elements found in the aesthetic are white birds and butterflies. This aesthetic could ironically be described as taking the term 'nightcore' too literally.For example, for Pink Parisian, one of the aesthetics on that site, people would tag it #pink, #old-hollywood, #feminine, #romantic, #vintage, #parisian, etc. This led to some variation on what appeared in the search bar. For example, the search term ""pink"" could bring up Fairy Kei, Morute, Delicate Sweet, and Pink Parisian. Because of this difficulty in finding terms with consistent aesthetics and users, ""Follow Forevers"" existed. These were lists of users that someone would compile after reaching a certain number of followers. In effect, these popular users were influencers who allowed their followers to find their sources of inspiration, which united the aesthetic further and created a more tight-knit community. An example of a Follow Forever could be found here.",2000s,,"Anime characters, the moon, moonlight, stars, angels, starry nights, waterfalls","Blue, white, purple, pink",
Bastardcore,https://aesthetics.fandom.com/wiki/Bastardcore,"An aesthetic based on Gryffindor, from the Harry Potter series. Bastardcore is supposed to strike your fight or flight response. It consists of friendly images along with shock humor themed captions or images that seem out of place and are uncomfortable to look at. One could argue that Bastardcore is an extension of the ""cursed images'"" meme. This aesthetic is commonly used by people who would refer to themselves as ""feral[1]"".

Popular shorts that fall under this aesthetic include:
Films (often comedies with dark or edgy humor and/or a rebellious spirit mixed in with seemingly mundane or wholesome situations, though they don't strictly have to be comedic either, they could simply have an edgy or rebellious style for its time filled with dark satire or characters who behave in an edgy or rebellious manner) that best embody this aesthetic may include:

Bimbocore,https://aesthetics.fandom.com/wiki/Bimbocore,"Fandom aesthetics are mood boards, playlists, and edits done based off of the aesthetic of a piece of media with a fandom. Users would take distinct visuals, colors, and attitudes associated with the setting of the work or a distinctive character design. These images would be arranged into either a square grid of nine photos or two columns that can span for however long the user sees fit. Bimbocore is an hyperfeminine aesthetic centered around pink and glitter, sexuality, old 2000s photos and hyperpop; sometimes rock or punk music with a bad girl theme, and pink things. The fashion style specifically is centered around body positivity for women, sexual appeal, and pink, Barbie-doll-like charm. Sometimes it can even go as far as attempting to become a ‘living Barbie doll’ through the use of extreme makeup and plastic surgery to achieve the perfect doll-like sexiness.
The term ""Bimbocore"" was coined in 2022 by Hannah Rose Collins, better known by her stage name Scene Queen, which she created as a subgenre of Metalcore with elements of Alternative Rock and Pop as well as hyperfeminine aesthetics. It would also serve as the name of her eponymous E.P: Bimbocore. It would later spread to TikTok as an aesthetic including many other songs and musical genres, like Bimbo Doll by Tila Tsoli.
The style is mainly inspired by the 2000s McBling aesthetic as well as Barbiecore. It is very similar to Bubblegum Bitch, which is also inspired by these, except that it lacks the same level of bad bitch, ""fuck this"" energy. There is also a connection to the baddie subtype of the Babygirl aesthetic as well as Bubblegum Coquette. It is also somewhat related to Stripcore.
Bimbocore is related to ‘Bimbofication’ which has two meanings. The first is a BDSM kink where someone (usually a woman; for a man it would be sissification), is transformed into a stereotypical airheaded slut perfectly happy to be used (consensually). The second type is a feminist movement among Gen-Z relating to taking back femininity by adopting a hyperfeminine style and pretending to be a dumb bimbo to manipulate men.
The fashion of Bimbocore is mainly inspired by 2000s fashion.
A term for members of the Goth subculture and/or E-Girls that embrace elements from both aesthetics to create a look that is both edgy and glamorous. It generally features dark body-conscious outfits, visible cleavage, shiny/latex corsets, gemstone chokers, bondage elements, and dramatic makeup with bold eyeliner and plump lips. This style is highly associated with the ""big titty goth GF"" meme as well as the Dark Babygirl aesthetic.
Winter Bimbo, also known as Winter Fairy Coquette is a subtype of both Bimbocore and Coquette as well as including aspects of other aesthetics like Snowdrop, Pink Christmas, Slavic Dolls, Snow Bunny, and Fairy Grunge.
Himbocore is the aesthetic centering around Himbos, the male counterpart to the Bimbo. This aesthetic can range from looking very similar to Bimbocore (except with less overt femininity), to being extremely hyper-masculine.

Blingeecore,https://aesthetics.fandom.com/wiki/Blingeecore,"Blingeecore, sometimes also called Glittercore, is an internet aesthetic based around the nostalgia and revival of old GIF graphics originating from websites such as Blingee or PicMix. Its iconic visuals represent Blingee stamps and layered images featuring motifs such as sparkles, glitter, stars, typical Emo art, floral graphics, etc. Generally, Blingeecore is often associated with the Scene and Animecore aesthetics, but not necessarily.
The timeless style of Blingee and PicMix GIFs also influenced a lot of online art movements and aesthetics, most notably Scene art, Sigilkore and Draincore. Although once considered tacky, many people still appreciate and enjoy the filters and special effects from said apps, leading to the style growing into its own aesthetic and making a comeback due to nostalgia. It is worth mentioning some Blingeecore images and GIFs have the potential to cause eyestrain or seizures due to their flashing visuals.
Most Blingeecore images and edits come in a GIF format, but the aesthetic is often also applied to regular images. Blingeecore visuals may be considered kitsch by many people due to their flashing and low quality style. For example, a fan of Harley Quinn would make a mood board that has an image of a playing card, smudged lipstick, a quote about toxic love, and a strong use of the color red. One of the most popular examples, and arguably a precursor to Dark Academia, are the Harry Potter mood boards, which were very popular due to the diversity of themes such as Hogwarts Houses or important buildings.",Mid-2000s,,"Blingee stamps, sparkles, glitter, floral graphics, Emo art, anime characters, skulls, butterflies, stars, hearts, checkered patterns","Fuchsia, black, white, purple",

Some noticeable motifs and values centered of this aesthetic are, unsurprisingly, flowers and romance.The people who create these fandom mood boards were expressing their love of the fandom and both the aesthetic community and the fandom would reblog their work. The presence of fandom mood boards have diminished in the following years, largely because of the rise of aesthetics that are unaffiliated with fiction, the general loss of fangirl enthusiasm (see the section on Dashcon for a better explanation), and migration to other websites.",Possibly 2010s,,"Gardens, flowers, fresh fruit, spring","Bright colors, pastels, green and white",

Being widely popular, the aesthetic has undoubtedly gained criticisms over the last couple of years. The aesthetic has been criticized for being unobtainable, classist, ageist, racist, and fatphobic.[7]
The main criticism involving this aesthetic is the fact that the products that the ""clean girl"" promotes are brands like Drunk Elephant, Bubble, etc. and have tons of them. The issue with this is the fact that these brands and the promoted sheer quantity are the price. The aesthetic is clearly marketed towards wealthy women, with an ideal skincare routine being $175-$400.

There are also Lolita coords based on clowns which can be worn sometimes as part of both aesthetics(especially under Pastel Clowncore).
Pastel Clowncore is a more kawaii version of Clowncore that uses pastel colours. While regular Clowncore is associated with Kidcore, Pastel Clowncore may be more associated with Babycore.
Dark Clowncore involves creepy, eerie, gory, and sometimes gothic images and fashion relating to clowns and circuses.
This in many ways is more common than Clowncore itself thanks to the popularity of comic book supervillains like The Joker and Harley Quinn. When combined with Pastel Clowncore, this can result in a creepy-cute aesthetic similar to Pastel Goth or even Cutecore or Morute.
Mimecore is about looking like a mime by wearing berets, black and white shirts, gloves, and makeup, as well as acting like one by using gestures to communicate instead of talking. It is similar to clowncore as both aesthetics are about looking and acting like the style of a certain type of traditional entertainer.

Coquette,https://aesthetics.fandom.com/wiki/Coquette,"Coquette is a Girly aesthetic that includes similar feminine sub-aesthetics generally associated with Lana Del Rey and mostly enjoyed by teenage girls.
The aesthetic evolved since the mid-2010s on Tumblr, where the term originated from a community based on pursuing the persona of the Nymphet—a sexually precocious young girl who seduces older men, created in the mind of the unreliable narrator of Lolita by Vladimir Nabokov.[1] Then, the name changed to coquette in order to circumvent the ban on the term Nymphet on many social media sites. Coquette is a French word referring to an attractive, flirtatious young woman (not 'little girl' which is why the term is preferred). The Nymphet influence is what separates newer Coquette subtypes from other similar girly aesthetics.
However, it is important to note that the majority of Nymphets don’t support the sexualization of little girls, instead it focuses more on age gaps and daddy issues. But because of mass-tagging and the ubiquity of the Nymphet community on that site, many photos unrelated to the aesthetic of the novel and film were tagged under Coquette.
Now, Coquette is a broad search term for a hyper-feminine aesthetic that incorporate elements of youth and teenage girlhood and are inspired by the original Nymphet aesthetic. The visual elements of the different aesthetics vary, but they generally involve an emphasis on girly fashion and share an appreciation for Lana Del Rey's music and aesthetic, due to her songs focusing on girlhood and flirtation/seduction. The aesthetic is also contrary to the visuals favored by most teenaged girls, as all variations involve things that are ""frillier"" and more vintage in appearance compared to mainstream trends.
Sometimes, there are mentions of promiscuity, mental illness, and drugs, but this is not unusual in the culture of high school-aged girls. The imagery of coquette is considered in line with conventional attractiveness in Western society, with a large part of the community focusing on appearing attractive such as in fashion, makeup, and sometimes body type.
This page is an index for the many subaesthetics that can be tagged under coquette, as well as a brief explanation and a gallery.
This is the music that people in the coquette aesthetic listen to:
Nymphet, also sometimes referred to as Vintage Americana Coquette, is an aesthetic based on a character trope originated by Vladimir Nabokov - ""Lolita"", published in 1955 and its movie adaptations from 1962 and 1997. Nymphet is an illusion created in the mind of Humbert Humbert, the (unreliable) main character and narrator of both the films and book. For the term, it is used by Humbert as a way to justify his predatory actions towards 12 year old Dolores Haze, his victim, by portraying her as sexually precocious and actually desiring him. Even though this style has problematic origins, many users enjoy Dolores’s fashion sense without romanticizing her abuse.
At around 2014, on Tumblr, young women took on this trope for themselves, as it was an aesthetic surrounding femininity, tragedy, and burgeoning sexuality. Contemporary pop culture involved a lot of content relating to teenage girlhood and the drama/romanticism of growing up quickly and being involved with risqué behavior. Lana Del Rey and her album Born to Die is a main inspiration in the aesthetic. Because of the era the book Lolita takes place in, this aesthetic centers around vintage Americana imagery and the 1950s schoolgirl look.
Dark Nymphet, also known as Dark Coquette, is a coquette substyle rooted in '50s and '60s coquette culture. It is closely related to the Femme Fatale Hollywood archetype, although it has more youthful, Nymphet themes, than seen in traditional femme fatale. Vamps typically embody beauty, mystery, seduction, and danger. Cocktail dresses, evening gowns or pencil dresses and fitted suits all belong to fashion associated with Vamps, the outfits often finished with furs, veiled hats, but also lace, ruffles, and bows, and always with killer heels. This aesthetic also has influence from Kinderwhore and other darker aesthetics, with a more ‘messy’ look popular. Dark red and black are the most popular colors.
Vamp icons include, but are not limited to, Marilyn Monroe, Sharon Stone, Lana Del Rey, Mary Astor, Angelina Jolie, Gloria Swanson, and so on.
Dollette is an interpretation of Coquette that highly started to spread in popularity in the 2020s. It can be largely found on Pinterest and TikTok. The aesthetic is largely based on fashion and hyperfeminine visual cues such as florals, ballet, the color pink, flowers, and makeup. This is what most people imagine when they think of Coquette. Apart from Nymphet, it is largely inspired by Pink Princess, Pink Parisian, Delicate Sweet, and Balletcore.
This trend is also highly associated with the secondhand clothing online retailer Depop. Coquette came to be a search term encompassing delicate and feminine fashion from the early 2000s, as well as Japanese brands that fit the aesthetic. Many items in this aesthetic became highly desirable and expensive, with lots of hype surrounding the pieces, especially the Bebe milkmaid top.
Dollette style is all about femininity, charm, and a touch of flirtatious allure. This style often combines elements of vintage fashion with a modern twist, focusing on delicate fabrics, soft pastel colors, ruffles, and lace. Coquette fashion, as the name implies, is designed to enhance the wearer's charm, and is inspired by a blend of historical eras such as the Victorian age and the playful silhouettes of the 1950s.
Coquette style celebrates the power of feminine allure and romantic elegance. It draws inspiration from fashion icons such as Audrey Hepburn, whose timeless grace perfectly embodies the ethos of this style. Key elements include high-waist skirts, lace blouses, ribbon details, and chic accessories like pearl necklaces or small, dainty handbags.
Farmer's Daughter is a more Country-like variation on the Coquette aesthetic where the visuals revolve around the character of a farmer's daughter, a Nymphet interpretation of a girl living in rural American farmland who is hyper-feminine and sexually precocious. This is in contrast with the actual aesthetic preferences of women in rural America. There is a lot of similarity with Nymphet, because of the Americana elements, as well as Trailer Park Princess because of the trashy look.
This aesthetic is largely on Pinterest and TikTok.
Coconut Girl (also known as Malibu Barbie or Key West Kitten) centers around the Coquette interpretation of tropical beaches typically associated with Florida from the 1960s to the 2000s. It creates an atmosphere that expresses the femininity and youth associated with young women vacationing during the summertime. Although it is considered a Coquette subtype, Coconut Girl is also associated with Barbiecore and Bimbocore, and is often called Malibu Barbie. Key West Kitten is very similar to Bubblegum Coquette in terms of bright colors as well as hyperfeminine/kawaii aesthetic overlap.
Waif is a type of blogger who posts content relating to beautiful, intelligent, self-destructive, and manipulative teenage girls. Arguably, it can be seen as a continuation of Heroin Chic, and it was influenced by Dark Coquette, Dark Balletcore the Pro-Ana/thinspo community, and the humor of the podcast The Red Scare. In addition to aesthetic images, much of this information comes from memes, Whisper confessions, and text posts of things happening within their personal lives.
What distinguishes this aesthetic from the previous aesthetics above is the persona of these bloggers. Specifically, the memes and text posts produced have a flippant or egocentric tone. However, these girls are using it as an expression of their mental illness. In addition to the glamour of independent and precocious lives of parties, money, and influence, there are multiple references to drug use, depression, eating disorders, and the desire to gain male attention from their looks.
Waif isn’t really a seperate type of Coquette but rather a representation of the more toxic and dark side of the Coquette aesthetic.
Winter Fairy Coquette is a presentation of warm clothing in a coquette - fairy grunge aesthetic. It is also called Winter Bimbo.
Since coquette and fairy grunge are very different, this fashion style ranges from looking delicate like coquette, snow drop and softie - to the torn and harsh textures and fantastical aspect of fairy grunge and avant apocalypse.
The clothing colors are predominantly white, but may include some pastels, beige, light brown, and dark colors for variety.
Not to be confused with Dark Coquette/Dark Nymphet. Gloomy Coquette, also sometimes called Delicate Sweet, is gloomier version of Dollette, which includes gloomy and desaturated visuals associated with girlhood, angels, nature, dolls, and reading.
Morute is sometimes confused with Gloomy Coquette, but differs in that it includes morbid and creepy imagery such as graveyards, creepy dolls, bruises, insects, and trauma-related imagery, to give some examples. Morute can also look similar to Kinderwhore and Dollcore, which also share visuals with Gloomy Coquette.
Unlike Dark Coquette, Gloomy Coquette is still similar to Dollette and uses pink and light feminine clothing. Trailer Park Princess also overlaps a lot with Gloomy Coquette, although the latter is more overtly sexual and trashy, with lingerie as well as bondage items/clothing similar to the Babygirl aesthetic.
Bubblegum Coquette can be seen as both a sub genre of coquette and Bimbocore, focused on nostalgia for people born from the late 90s to mid 2000s, who experienced the 2000s and early 2010s as children, thus seeing the McBling and 2014 Girly aesthetics of the time through a childish perspective. It is very similar to the Babygirl aesthetic.
Bubblegum Coquette also has similar motifs to Nymphet, such as holding onto adolescence whilst being grown up and enjoying what it comes with it.
Incorporating the Nymphet, Bimbocore and Jojifuku/Yume Kawaii aesthetics, Bubblegum Coquette is a bright pink sub genre of Coquette. It's centered around the early 2000s childhood nostalgia, cotton candy, bows, pastries, roller skates, lollipops and all pink things.
Coquette Academia combines the soft femininity of Dollette, Gloomy Coquette, and sometimes Dark Coquette, with the Romantic Academia and Ballet Academia aesthetics.
The Trailer Park Princess aesthetic combines Nymphet and Gloomy Coquette with a more trashy, sexy, adult look, with lingerie and even bondage gear being some of the common visuals along with trailer parks, plastic tiaras, and Vintage Americana. It is also somewhat influenced by McBling, and is somewhat similar to Bubblegum Coquette except less childish/innocent and more mature/trashy. There is also a strong influence from 60s fashion, particularly the Dolly Girl look, which is why it is sometimes called ‘60’s Babydoll’.
Blokette was coined by Nymphet Alumni in late 2022, combining Coquette and Blokecore aesthetics. The blokette aesthetic also takes inspiration from Balletcore, Waif, and Indie Sleaze aesthetics.
A combination of Trailer Park Princess and Farmer's Daughter, Buckle Bunny focuses on a Coquette interpretation of the Cowgirl aesthetic.

Cottagecore,https://aesthetics.fandom.com/wiki/Cottagecore,"Cottagecore is an aesthetic inspired by a romanticized interpretation of western agricultural life, particularly in the pre-industrial era. It is centered on ideas of simple living and harmony with nature. Other themes associated with cottagecore include self-sufficiency, the romanticization of domestic labor, and caring for people. While the aesthetic is prevalent on several social media sites, such as on Instagram and more recently TikTok, the community originated on Tumblr. However, this is an internet and visual-centered look on prior decorative, literary, and historical trends. It is particularly popular within woman-loving-woman (WLW) and nonbinary loving women (NBLW) communities (although sexuality does not define the aesthetic and it is also commonly seen among straight Tradwives).
The aesthetic is a continuation of many other nature-based aesthetics, but draws the most influence from the 19th century Romantic era and its romanticization of pre-industrial life. Its visuals are based on the domestic lifestyle associated with living in this type of environment, with all images providing a sense of comfort and mild adventure.
Despite a number of its followers taking a progressive and subversive outlook, Cottagecore has been also criticized for its romanticism of eurocentric farming life. It has also been criticized in the context of North American and Australian settings, an inadvertent celebration of the aesthetics of colonialism, as well as the ways it often simplifies and underestimates the labor of farmers. It is due to these connotations that the use of Cottagecore aesthetics has been adopted by the TradWife community and members of the far-right as forms of propaganda. This has led to media criticism despite their opposition to LGBTQ+ and anti-capitalist adherents of Cottagecore. Also, due to the fact that Cottagecore is based on pre-industrial farm life which existed all around the world, it does not have to be exclusively based on European history and in fact is partially inspired by the Japanese aesthetic Morí Kei.
Cottagecore is often compared to aesthetics such as Grandparentcore and Shabby Chic, which seek to evoke a similar sense of nostalgia. It is also related to Naturecore, Bloomcore, Mushroomcore, and Warmcore. Fairycore and Fairytale are similar to Cottagecore but with a more magical, Ethereal twist. Country and Farmcore are also very similar to Cottagecore except with a focus on modern agricultural life. Earthcore is similar to Cottagecore but more modern and focuses on environmentalism.
Cottagecore is a continuation of ideas that have existed for millenia and uses visuals that are based in the aesthetic of the European countrysides. The evolution of these ideas into contemporary Cottagecore, an aesthetic borne out of the internet and among teenagers to young adults, is the primary history of this section, but also describes the history of Cottagecore's precursors as well.
One of the largest influences was the Victorian artistic movement of Romanticism, which emphasized a connection to nature, the past, and the senses, rather than logic.[1] It also encouraged a sense of national pride, which led to British landscape artists in particular to paint scenes of rural small towns, often with the same thatched cottages admired today. Similarly, this artistic movement was a reaction to the Industrial Revolution, much like how Cottagecore now is against the increasingly capitalistic and industrialized economy.
The next artistic movement that revived this love for British cottages is the Arts and Crafts movement, which focused on decorative arts such as furniture, ceramics, illustration, etc. Floral patterning was extremely popular, as well as a lighter and softer interpretation of what art is supposed to be.
Also around this time, Beatrix Potter released her Peter Rabbit children's books, which is one of the first introductions people had to the Victorian garden aesthetic, with the soft watercolors and sense of innocence. Other influential children's literature published in the 19th century include Heidi, The Secret Garden, and Anne of Green Gables. These books had a common appreciation for femininity and nature, and with lush descriptions of food and activities being prominenetly featured throughout. Despite their age, these works are incredibly popular with the children oftoday, and this nostalgia continues to inspire people who read these novels in their childhood.
An additional genre that ""created"" Cottagecore was also fantasy, especially with J.R.R. Tolkien's Lord of the Rings series and various fairytales, especially that of the fae in Britain and Ireland. These books lend a sense of adventure and folkloric superstition to the aesthetic, and it is not uncommon for appreciators to do a few rituals typically associated with fairies for the sake of them.
Throughout the development of film, animation, TV, etc., many works had their settings in small European villages and forests.
Visually, much of Cottagecore takes inspiration from the 1970s, which had a fashion and home decor aesthetic known as Romantic Revival and Shabby Chic, led mostly by the companies Gunne Sax and Laura Ashley. Cottagecore fashion is largely a continuation of the designs that they used: prairie dresses in floral calico print, with heirloom sewing details, antique furniture, and soft pastels. The interior design details of Shabby Chic have similar grandmotherly connotations.
The Scandinavian concept of Hygge became popular worldwide in the 2010s, which also had an influence on the development of Cottagecore. Hygge focuses on comfort and coziness especially during the wintertime.
The Japanese alternative fashion Mori Kei also had an extremely large influence on the aesthetic, especially since the fashion was popular on tumblr in the early to mid-2010s. This was the de-facto feminine, nature-based, and cozy aesthetic. However, like many other trends, Mori Kei dwindled out. But as Cottagecore gained in popularity, there was a spike in Google trend searches for the fashion, showing a clear lineage in the fashion.[2]
Some cottagecore fashion takes inspiration from the Rococo era, especially as seen in films such as Marie Antionette(2006). In a lot of ways, Marie Antionette was one of the first people to have a Cottagecore aesthetic since she had a model village, known as the Queen’s Hamlet, built for herself. This leads to overlap with the Princesscore/Pink Princess aesthetics, particularly for the more Girly Girl enjoyers of the aesthetic.
In 2019 Tumblr[3], the animated show Moomin Valley became a meme and frequent topic of conversation on the website. It popularized Cottagecore, as the characters lived in this sort of environment, with scenes of foraging, frolicking, and adventuring. Tumblr users wished for this sort of lifestyle, and the television show became a common gateway to the aesthetic. Studio Ghibli animated films have also been quite prevalent on the site, and users would have noted the commonalities between these two franchises and explored similar photographs and activities.
During this same time, there was the trend of ""yearning"" on tumblr. Users would post about wishing for romantic partners and situations to happen, focusing on ""tenderness"" such as holding hands and sharing fruit. This was especially popular among the queer community, which is constantly in the process of redefining and creating images of love outside of the heteronormative imagery and traditions of the past.
The 2020 coronavirus pandemic also led to the rise of Cottagecore as activities such as baking bread[4], playing Animal Crossing[5], gardening, sewing, and other handicrafts[6] rose in popularity. Coupled with a rise of the app TikTok, people were more exposed to crafting and these activities became trends. The virality of Little Women (2019) was another contributing factor to the popularity amongst teenaged girls.
Another quarantine trend in 2020 was Lirika Matoshi's ""Strawberry Dress,"" a pink tulle gown with sequined strawberries and a milkmaid style. As Vogue describes it, the appeal of the dress is ""...that sweet strawberry print is deeply nostalgic, hearkening back to a time long before COVID-19, to a childhood innocence that feels especially soothing right now."" Like Moomin Valley, the dress was incredibly meme-ified, with it appearing in non-Cottagecore contexts, such as in fan-art.[7] Its popularity led to people, especially on TikTok, to discover the aesthetic.
Throughout 2020, Cottagecore was made aware to various audiences as publications such as Vox and The New York Times reported on the trend. It later filtered down to various magazines and other interest sites, making the aesthetic's name fairly well-known among fashion, interior design, and crafting enthusiasts.
The aesthetic became even more well-known with the release of Taylor Swift's July 2020 album Folklore, as the singer's visual and musical styles would influence many of her fans' tastes.[8]
Cottagecore has a naturalistic color palette with light green foliage, browns of natural stones and wood, straw, and flowers. Pastels are common in painting. Lighting is always natural, with sunlight being the de facto light source. Morning to late afternoon ""golden hour"" is the range of lighting.
Different motifs appear throughout Cottagecore in various ways; rather than limiting a photo subject to just pictures of its natural form, some items appear in various mediums, such as in illustration, printed fabric, novelty dishware, and other manners of home decor. The most common motifs are: strawberries, mushrooms, and flowers.
Nature is one the main visuals of the aesthetic. One of the most common photographic subjects is wild fields of grass with small wildflowers dotted throughout.
Deciduous forest is also common, always in green during spring and summer, with autumnal colors and wintertime being rare.
Unlike more wild aesthetics such as Naturecore, there are almost always signs of human involvement in the rural space. Fences, bridges, clothes lines, picnicking, and controlled amounts of forestation are more often than not, elements of these images. In Cottagecore, humans have to have presence in the natural environment, shaping the landscape into home.
Gardens are of course a manifestation of this interaction between nature and human intervention. These gardens are always done in the English style, meaning that the land is cultivated to look more wild and with great variety, rather than geometric and controlled.[9] Ponds are often included, as well as wheelbarrows, wooden benches, gazebos, and other garden paraphernalia. Often, large and ornate glass greenhouses are featured, which are more in line with a wealthy, English nobility aesthetic as opposed to modest and attainable rural life. More mundane and achievable gardens can be featured, and they largely focus on the crops grown there, such as frills of lettuce sprouting from the ground or strawberries in a white-washed planter box.
A traditional English cottage with a thatched roof
The other main visual, and the one that gives Cottagecore its namesake is the cottage, which is a fairly loose term that includes multiple types of homes. The most common Cottagecore house is the archetypical English thatch-roofed cottage with painted white or rusticated stone walls, chimneys, and shrubbery in the front. The second-most common is a miniature house or shed constructed from wood, with a gabled roof. Novel and twee decorations and painting is common in these miniature houses, and they are typically painted in pastel, feature decorative carvings, and windowboxes filed with plants. English manors are also heavily featured in Cottagecore, and fit many aesthetics, such as Tudor, Cottage Orne, and even Neoclassical, among others. These mansions are typically more extravagent than what Cottagecore is claimed to be, which will be expanded upon in the Controversy section. Architecture that is incredibly fanciful and fairy-tale-esque is also common. They often look to be falling apart, sloping, or impossibly precarious. This fits into the fairy and witch influences.
Images of the interiors of these cottages are also common and the way how Cottagecore enthusiasts can express their love for the aesthetic without living in the countryside setting, similar to Soft Countriana. These interiors show the farmhouse-style furniture, linens, and various knicknacks that would exist in the space. The objects are frequently cluttered and mismatched to create a cozy and carefree atmosphere and are frequently connotative of grandparents, such as quilts, tea sets, and vintage crockery. However, unlike other kitschy aesthetics, these items tend to be practical and have a united aesthetic with similar motifs and a limited color palette. Continuing with the nature motifs, plants are frequently featured in interiors, with flowers, potted plants, and floral and strawberry motifs on various mediums.
Labor and handicrafts associated with the cottage lifestyle, and the results from it, are incredibly popular. See activities for a list of full details.

Animals found within the setting are another photographic subject. The ones showcased are either domesticated animals such as cows, cats, dogs, ducks, rabbits, and sheep, or wild animals that would exist in the same field and forest setting such as frogs, mice, butterflies, and squirrels. These animals would be considered ""cute"" and are often in poses that carry across docility and relaxation. For example, cats sleeping on windowsills or frogs crossing their arms.
Food is another important visual of the aesthetic. The results of foraging: baskets full of mushrooms, berries, and other fresh fruits celebrate the Earth's bounty and the joy found in the activity. Baked goods, bread, and other sweet foods also contribute a cozy atmosphere to the aesthetic, as it carries across the warmth and romantic labor associated with making it. This is almost always traditional Western. Fruit pies, loaves of bread, jars of jam and honey, pancakes, Victoria sponges, and other rustic cakes are the most common.
Books, an outlet for fantasy and independent learning, are frequent. These are always vintage with a romantic storybook or classical feel, similar to what’s seen in Romantic Academia, with either antique leather and canvas or more approchable secondhand paperbacks. In connection with this, journals and letters are also considered part of the aesthetic as they convey the tenderness and intimacy associated with doing things with one's hands. Writing and reading will be expanded further in the activities section.
A comparison of different Cottagecore illustrations; left is Cicely Mary Barker's 1923 illustrations, right is Lara Hacker's 2019 illustration. Both are very different in style, but carry across the Cottagecore aesthetic.
Another common medium of imagery of the aesthetic are illustrations. Botanical encyclopedias prior to the widespread use of colored photography are the most common. These watercolors provide detailed views of plants, typically flowers, in a way that evokes both the natural subject and the romanticization of naturalists' dedication to the subject matter during the era. Victorian to 1930s illustration, specifically of children's literature, is another important source of both inspiration and actual involvement in the aesthetic. Fairies and anthropromorphic animals (such as those of Beatrix Potter’s works) are the most common. These are done in a more detailed and naturalistic style in watercolor and ink. However, as Cottagecore became popular, artists who specialize in digital and more simplistic art introduced a flatter and more cute style.
There is a wide range of outfit styles that could fit into the Cottagecore aesthetic. Cottagecore fashion tends to fall into either a hyper-feminine, modernized interpretation of historical fashion or a more practical and cozy outfit that includes elements of whimsy. In most interpretations, the silhouette is more modest than mainstream fashion, with a longer, loose-fitting, flowy dresses and skirts often (but not always) reminiscent of housework wear from the 1900s-50s.
The colors in Cottagecore tend to be naturally occurring, pastel, or faded colours, including brown, baby pink, olive green, ivory, maroon, beige, ochre, dusty rose pink, light yellow, and baby blue. Patterns such as stripes, paisley, delicate floral, and gingham are popular within the aesthetic. The fabrics are most often natural, such as in cotton, linens, knitted yarn, etc. Lace and embroidery are some common trimmings.
Many of these clothes are vintage and purchased secondhand, such as from thrift stores or vintage shops. This is in line with the appreciation for the environment and sustainability, as well as the fact that many Cottagecore pieces are highly sought-after because of their rarity in modern times and un-replicable unique design, such as in Gunne Sax dresses, Edwardian blouses, and antique aprons. A core tenent of the fashion aspect is also DIY, with OP-made crochet, handsewing, knitting, and jewelry making being incorporated into outfits. However, as the aesthetic has become incredibly popular, it reached fast fashion, and many clothes found in mall brands have elements of Cottagecore motifs, especially with milkmaid tops.
Puffy poet or Edwardian-inspired blouses that include lace, ruffle, embroidery, or ribbon details are incredibly popular in the vintage/historical style that leans towards fantasy or elegance. These pieces are often found vintage, as this style was extremely popular in 70s romantic fashion.
Some looks also include tee shirts that have a print that relates to the aesthetic.
Vests, corsets, shawls, and other layering pieces are also often used as a way to introduce texture and color on the upper portion of the outfit.
Cottagecore fashion commonly involves:
The hair and make-up of Cottagecore is either naturalistic, or in more fantastical interpretations, with fairy-like motifs. Hair that is kept long is associated with tradition and femininity. Long hair that is loose tends to be in waves or braids.

While the cottagecore aesthetic is not necessarily an organized political movement with stated goals or leaders, much of the conversation around cottagecore is political, especially given the aesthetic has become infamous for its association with two directly opposed political groups with radically different outlooks on life despite the shared frustration with modernity.
While the opposition to modern life is shared among Cottagecore adherents across the political spectrum, what is specifically being opposed tends to vary. For more progressive-leaning followers of the aesthetic, it is particularly capitalism as well as heteronormativity. While many people involved in cottagecore identify with an ideology that more concretely advocates for the restructuring of society, they may also express a dislike of capitalism in a more casual tone through or alongside cottagecore.[10]
Many progressive-leaning members of the cottagecore community reject heteronormative gender roles and seek to remove the stigma and stereotypes of traditional life from the aesthetics and culture of times past. Cottagecore enjoys niche popularity within the LGBTQ+ community, particularly among lesbian and bisexual women, for this reason. Many express dissatisfaction with the roles and expectations placed on them in a heteronormative society. Some have suggested that cottagecore presents an ideal world in which young people are able to express their personality freely in a rural space, contrasting the homophobia or transphobia faced by young people in rural areas.[11]

On the other side of the political spectrum, another more controversial large community subscribing to the aesthetic is the Tradwife movement[12], found largely on Instagram and Facebook's ""Politigram"" community.[13] Contrasting the progressive Cottagecore community, the rightist adherents to the aesthetic proclaim their opposition to modernity is based on a loss of conservative values in the 21st Century and fondness for a pre- rather than a post-capitalist economic system. Tradwives specifically are described as women who ""embrace 'submissive' heteronormative lifestyles involving homemaking and child-rearing and reject feminism"" according to Wikipedia. Members of the tradwife movement often utilize cottagecore imagery, fashion, memes, and aesthetics to promote their views. They may also romanticize the revitalization of traditional heteronormative gender roles for women, a popular aspect of far-right ideology. Even further niche is the utilization of Cottagecore imagery and inspired memes by Eco-fascist[14] and Eco-nationalist circles who openly and intentionally uphold western colonialist and eurocentric views as an ideal as opposed to accidentally as was the criticism for Progressive Cottagecore followers. However, those within the Tradwife movement often do not associate openly with the cottagecore community and the two sides oppose each other.[15]

The music associated with Cottagecore evokes comfort and gentleness through low and soft vocals and acoustic mid-tempo instrumentation. In lyrics, there would be references to either gentle love and/or nature.
Most of this style/aesthetic seems to have originated in the Hippie, Folk, and Baroque Pop scenes of the late 60s, which was heavily influenced by the Pre-Raphaelite movement. Many artists, men and women, embraced a soft, pastoral, prairie style and wore poet shirts, lacy maxi dresses, and flowers (examples include The Carpenters and Donovan).
This continued into the 70s Soft Rock scene (Fleetwood Mac being of key importance) and through the 80s revival of Baroque Pop in Post-Punk (like Shelleyan Orphan and Virginia Astley). Some Dream Pop and Indie Rock of the late 80s and early 90s continued somewhat in this vein, although their external aesthetic had become more contemporary over time.
In the modern era, much sudo-indie rock and pop is used. In this regard Dark Folk and other genres tend to slip in and, although related, are definitely not as closely connected to the imagery that lead to Cottagecore’s development and are more visually related to Cottagegore.

The activities associated with Cottagecore are defined by the typical activities one can do within the cottage space.
Gardencore is a subtype of Cottagecore centered around gardens, this aesthetic is closely related to Bloomcore and Villagecore. Gardencore also features greenhouses or Victorian-style gardens, the gardens don't always have to be complicated and large, they can be small as well.
Cottagegore is a darker take on the Cottagecore aesthetic with more of a focus on the more negative aspects of cottage and natural life that Cottagecore often tries to veer away from.
Honeycore is an aesthetic based around the rural production and consumption of goods such as honey, bread, and waffles. It is similar to Cottagecore in that agricultural imagery and values are emphasized, but the visuals are streamlined to create a color palette of mostly pale yellows and browns. In many of the pictures that can be classified into the Honeycore aesthetic, bees, honey, or flowers can be seen and there is a big emphasis on agriculture and conservation of bees.
Southwest Cottagecore moves away from the forest-inspired, green color palette of Cottagecore. The willows and vines are switched out with succulents. The main aspects are quite identical, just adapted to more southern/western life. Instead of a stone cottage, you may prefer an adobe house framed by yuccas. The fashion becomes more suited for warm weather and is generally paired with warm colors and the occasional nautical, whimsical look, characterized by run-down shacks on the coast and beach grass. Lizards, rabbits, snakes, and hawks are characteristic of the aesthetic.

Many critics of Cottagecore point out that the trendification of rural practices and ways of life would be harmful to the environment. High populations of settlers would overpopulate the areas, ironically driving out the practices that Cottagecore enthusiasts strive for. For example, foraging could not be supported if hundreds do it, as the humans who do so would quickly exhaust the availability of the resources. Then, as the berry bushes reduce in amount, disrupting the ecosystem and causing possible ecological collapse.
The fact that Cottagecore content creators create Cottagecore content is also, ironically, contradictory to the aesthetic. The things associated with social media, such as having to build a brand, tracking trends, and even advertising the aesthetic, are contrary to Cottagecore emphasis on nature and disconnecting from these alienating websites. In seeing Cottagecore as a way to make content and have social media approval, the messaging becomes lost.
Not necessarily problematic, but another criticism is the unrealistic ""fairy tale"" image of rural life. Some rural dwellers are exasperated with the ignorance of these internet users, as the aesthetic does not display the difficult labor associated with farming, animal husbandry, and handicrafts.[17] This is especially contrasted with the visuals that are incongruous to the claims of self-sufficiency by Cottagecore enthusiasts. English manors necessitate servants and groundskeepers, gowns do not fit the agricultural lifestyle, real farm equipment does not appear, the materials cost money that could not be supported with small-scale farming and crafts, etc. People concerned with farming rights also claim that over-romanticization encourages an ignorant perspective on the actual lives of farmworkers, which are incredibly difficult, with back-breaking labor and economic issues. A false narrative of the farming lifestyle may encourage ignorance that patronizes the real lives of farmhands as the fans claim that they wish they were that occupational class.
Counterarguments claim that Cottagecore is an outlet for fantasy; the enthusiasts do not plan to actually move into these areas and survive on subsistance farming and experience hard labor. Instead, they try to incorporate it through small activities that they could realistically achieve in their daily non-rural lives. The aesthetic does not cause socio-economic issues, and the critics' claims are virtue-signaling and cynical exaggeration that puts down the interests of women, discourages diversity of interests, and takes away from the virtues of the aesthetic.
The popularization of an aesthetic leads to commercialization that is not in line with the ethos of Cottagecore sustainability. As the fashion industry took note of the rising trend, they kept up with demand through fast fashion practices that abuse the workers, pollute the environment, and take away from the labor of handmade and ethical fashion.
On Tumblr, Cottagecore is often used as a descriptor for the portrayal of lesbianism as nonsexual, inherently wholesome, and idyllic. As Tumblr was popular among many lesbians, the aesthetic of lesbians often included images and wishful textposts about women doing domestic labor, cuddling, and other images of idealized love. However, this has a negative repercussion; some lesbians are against their fellow lesbians and themselves being ""predatory,"" which is their interpretation of normal feelings of sexual attraction. Online culture made the ideal image of lesbianism as women acting in a Cottagecore manner, which often does not include masculine presentations, sexual behavior, and conflict. Gender roles connect to this, as the idea that women are inherently more wholesome and domestically inclined leads to lesbians' self-image being this.",2010s; inspired by pre-19th century,Beatrix Potter,"Cottages, farm animals, wildflowers, pies, crops, gingham, prairie, Laura Ashley","Green, Brown, Yellow, Cream/Off-White",
Cutegore,https://aesthetics.fandom.com/wiki/Cutegore,"Cutegore is an online aesthetic including image edits that combine typical kawaii imagery with slight traces of gore. Characters are often depicted with wounds, blood splatters, glitches, pixelations, and otherwise horrific motifs, as well as bedrooms with kawaii decor and bloodstains on the wall or tall dark figures.
The aesthetic is often conflated with Kawaii over its name, when in reality the term ""Cutecore"" was choosen in order to avoid shadowbans on social media triggered by mentions of the term ""gore"". However, TikTok users later interpreted the name Cutecore as Cutegore sans the gore, which leaves behind a more typical Kawaii aesthetic interpreted through a Western audience. To see more information, see the page ""Cutecore.""
The term ""Cutecore"" first emerged around the mid-2010s as short variant of ""cute but hardcore/brutal"" and was commonly used as the name of a music genre that combined the typical hardcore sound with kawaii noises. Many of the cover images resembled what would be now considered the average Cutecore edit with depictions of violence and blood.
As an aesthetic, Cutecore was coined and popularized by the Tumblr user Vo1dchan in 2020 who would often post gloomy or morbid pictures of their overly kawaii room, often also sporting McDonald's bags in the background.
Cutecore is based around the sentiment of corrupted childhood as its overall visuals. However, it is rather similar to Traumacore by the way that images are edited and the way it makes references to murder and trauma. The base for the aesthetic is media aimed at children and preteens of which images then get manipulated to adhere to the sentiment of a corrupted childhood. These can go many ways, such as adding blood, ominous shadow figures and eyes. This aesthetic is highly popular on TikTok, another social media app, sometimes used as a joke. The typical aesthetic edits can also be used to cope with trauma.
This section lists media that is commonly used as part of the Cutecore aesthetic, often in the form of edits, rather than the typical visuals being featured within the media.
Songs frequently used as part of the aesthetic include:
Ever since the ""kawaii is a slur"" discourse that occured primarily on TikTok in 2021 [1], the aesthetic was getting accused of being a ""whitewashed"" version of Kawaii due to the term Cutecore being misunderstood as a western replacement word for it. There was also the argument of people saying ""Kawaii translates to cute"" or ""Just use Cutecore, it makes more sense"" despite it being a gore-centric aesthetic.[2] The term 'Cutecore' was deliberately selected for the aesthetic to disassociate itself from 'gore' terminology within media and avoid any negative connotations previously associated with the latter.
Cutecore often faces backlash for problematic individuals who engage in the aesthetic and its community. There has been a prevalence of people who abuse the aesthetic to glorify violence, self-harm, and CSA within its media as well as general toxic behavior (harassment, suicide baiting, etc).[3] Like any aesthetic linked to Kawaii, there have been accusations of yellowface towards Cutecore as well. Occasionally, Cutecore also gets criticized for 'ruining' characters from well-known series aimed at children.
Backlash frequently arises from within the community concerning items from brands such as Sanrio, Mezzo Piano, and San-X, with criticisms centered on their perceived overpricing, whether they are regular items or collector's items, largely being attributed to the Cutecore aesthetic.",2020,,Mixing cutesy and kawaii content with eerie or creepy content.,"Black, pink, red and yellow",
Cyber Stylin',https://aesthetics.fandom.com/wiki/Cyber_Stylin%27,"Cyber Stylin' is inspired by dress up games from the mid-2000s to early 2010s, pixel dolls (also known as Dollz),[1] dolls from the 2000s/2010s, and fashionable illustrations of girls from the 2000s/2010s.
The term Cyber Stylin' can be used to generalize the common art styles during the time period, as well as virtual/pixel games, drawings, and illustrations meant for young girls at the time.
Despite the name Cyber Stylin' being a blanket term, there are many different art styles within it, usually depending on the artist.
Cyber Stylin' originates from virtual dress up games that were first made in the 90s. These games soon started to explode in popularity in the 2000s, with there being countless of websites solely dedicated to dress up games by the late 2000s, early 2010s, and mid 2010s.
For the most part, Cyber Stylin' is not limited to one specific look. The look of it can depend on the exact region that the doll, game, or drawing was made, as well as the personal style of the artist. However something that is consistent is a feminine/""girly"" look, along with Y2K elements in the clothings/accesories like:
Colors like pink, purple, white, brown, black, blue, and gold are also quite common in this style. It is not uncommon to see a more pastel color scheme or style of clothing. On the contrary, bold colors can also be seen.
Dress up dolls and pixel dolls from some East Asian countries may sometimes have more of a cute or ""kawaii"" style, but not all do.
Dance Pop and Electro Pop from the 2000s-2010s best suit Cyber Stylin' , however, music relating to modeling, runway walking, and catwalking also suit it. Theme songs for doll brands also work well, and in some cases, Hyperpop too.
Enakei is a Korean digital art depicting young beautiful girls. The style is from the Korean artist Park Suran.[2] Generally, there are two types of Enakei styles. Jennie Enakei, a more realistic and airbrushed version of the style, and Enakei, a more cartoonish take on the style. A similar style seems to be done by an artist named Mellow J. This style seems to have originated from 2010-2012
Dollz are likely one of the oldest virtual dolls, first being made in 1997, originating from the website ""The Palace"".[3] Similar to the dress up games we know today, Dollz were customizable, allowing you to add clothes and hair to a base body. Dollz are some of the most iconic virtual paper dolls, even having online communities dedicated around them. There are 5 general styles of Dollz: Preps, Minis, Wonderkins, Silents, and Diva. Although Dollz are not as popular as they once were, they still do have a community surrounding them.
Similar to Dollz, Candybar Dollmaker was a Korean version that was made in 2004. Compared to regular Dollz, Candybar Dollmaker not only allowed you to also customize a base body, but it was also very detailed. These games were very popular at the time, however it is difficult to find websites dedicated to them anymore.
Shoujo, literally meaning girl in Japanese, is a type of anime/manga genre with the demographic of young girls. The art style is usually very cute, contains exaggerated features, and is very stylized when it comes to hair, makeup, and fashion. Although not all shoujo manga has the same look as other Cyber Stylin' styles do, many do, especially those from the late 90s to 2000s.",2000s-2010s,illustration from chicaloca,"Femininity, nostalgia, youth","Pink, purple, white, brown, blue, black",
Cyberdelic,https://aesthetics.fandom.com/wiki/Cyberdelic,"Cyberdelic (also known as Cyberdelia) is a term used to the immersion in cyberspace as a psychedelic experience. It was the fusion of cyberculture and the psychedelic subculture into a new counterculture of the late 1980s to mid-1990s. Much like the Hippies and Psychedelia, Cyberdelic is consistently linked with the Cyberpunk aesthetic of the '80s, though it should be noted the two are separate aesthetics in their own right. It also has overlap with Early Cyber.
the ultimate escape from reality
Dr. Timothy Leary, a popular figure in the Hippie counterculture movement due to his strong endorsement of utilizing psychedelic drugs (specifically LSD), got on board with the Cyberdelic movement to push virtual reality (as well as the utilization of ""smart drugs"") as the wave of the future to create a potential futuristic utopia in place of psychedelics. It was popularized by the emerging Rave scene and cyberculture of the late 1980s to mid-1990s, which lead to the aesthetic's peak with the release of the movie Hackers in 1995. It was commonly seen in advertisements, rave flyers, and media from the 1990s.[1]
By the late 1990s, Cyberdelic and Early Cyber styles faded somewhat in favor of the newer Metalheart and Y2K Futurism aesthetics; its end was further hastened after the dot.com bubble burst in 2000. However, Cyberdelia has since gained ground again in the modern era as a form of escapism from the increasingly-dystopic reality that we currently face.[2]
Because the Cyberdelic aesthetic had evolved since the first term was coined, now it has a wide variety of visuals. The only thing that hasn't changed is the philosophy, which is using technology as a medium to transcend into a virtual-psychedelic landscape.
Cyberdelic fashion borrows heavily from elements of Cyberpunk and Cybergoth fashions (which makes sense, given Cyberdelic's close ties with the Cyberpunk culture in the 80s) with slight elements of Nintencore and Vaporwave mixed in for good measure. It's very bright, colorful, and cheery, but with a technological twist (a lot of LED charms and LED goggles can add to the effect of seeming otherworldly with your Cyberdelic fashion).
More often than not, what most people would describe as Cyberpunk or Cybergoth music can easily blend in with the Cyberdelic aesthetic, as well as a lot of early Madchester music. One album often cited as a prime example of Cyberdelic music is Billy Idol's 1993 flop album, Cyberpunk, due in part to the fact that, during the recording of this album, Idol was trying to re-invent his image and was also hanging around a lot with the aforementioned Timothy Leary.[2]",1980s,,"Early CGI, Kaleidoscopic patterns, acid colors, fractal forms",Rainbow,
Cyberghetto,https://aesthetics.fandom.com/wiki/Cyberghetto,"Cyberghetto is an aesthetic that intends to create a home on cyberspace for marginalized groups of people. The word is a compound of Cyber (referring to the internet and cyberspace) and Ghetto (generally used as a term to describe a group of marginalized individuals).
Cyberghetto visuals can borrow heavily from Vaporwave, Cyberpunk, Scene, and Hip-Hop fashions, often reflecting on the dark and seemingly-isolated feelings the adherent to Cyberghetto usually feels. These visuals can often touch on some rather dark subject matter like drug addiction, loneliness, heartbreak, and poverty.
Fashion-wise, Cyberghetto can be strongly reminiscent of the Y2K Futurism aesthetic, featuring very bright and bold colors mixed with very shiny elements that can see cuts of black mixed in to make the bold styles really stand out. However, unlike the Y2K aesthetic (where its usage is generally unironic and is what people thought the future would look like), their usage in Cyberghetto has a slightly darker twist to them, possibly leaning some into Cybergoth territory, but without the Gothic undertones.
Many people have criticized this aesthetic for its usage of the word ""ghetto"" and imagery people associate with being ""ghetto."" Because of this, it is criticized for being racist or classist, or romanticizing/profiting off of the struggles that poor POC face.
Musically, Cyberghetto tends to borrow heavily from Hyperpop and Seapunk.",2010s,,,"Bright, vibrant colors paired with black, silvers, and holographic color shifts.",
Cybermorphism,https://aesthetics.fandom.com/wiki/Cybermorphism,"Cybermorphism (formally known as Fluent Design) is an umbrella term for Glassmorphism, Neumorphism, and Claymorphism. They are closely related design aesthetics that combine elements of Skeuomorphism and Flat Design to create smooth and rounded 3D visuals, glass textures, see-through objects, subtle shadows, and gradients. These visual motifs are an amalgamation of multiple trends that have been developing for the last few years. It is often used in UI/UX designs to create a more realistic, natural look and feel.
The first elements of Cybermorphism can be traced all the way back to Apple's iOS 7 released in 2013. Apple played a significant role in its inception, introducing translucent backgrounds, subtle transparency effects, rounded corners, and gradients that paved the way for what we now recognize as Glassmorphism. Since its introduction, this design has undergone various transformations and gained broader recognition. For example, since 2016, Xiaomi, Huawei, Oppo and other brands custom UI's tried to imitate the UI/UX design of iOS. Microsoft's Fluent Design System design language released in 2017 showcases aspects of Glassmorphism, with its emphasis on transparency, soft lighting, and subtle depth effects.
The next pivotal design trend, Neumorphism, started in 2019 by independent Figma community designers in an effort to mix the old Skeuomorphic elements of the 2000s with the new minimalist and flat interfaces found in newer interfaces. Neumorphism was also inspired and owes its existence to Glassmorphism.
The first mainstream example of Cybermorphism would be the app icons from macOS Big Sur, released in late-2020, which had soft forms and subtle shading. In the following year, Microsoft releases Windows 11, that uses Fluent Design for the UI, as well as the introduction of 3D emojis, icons, and abstract wallpapers. Other than that, Cybermorphism remained niched to small to mid-sized companies, startups, and independent creators. Also, in 2021, a similar trend to Neumorphism emerged called Claymorphism, which creates interfaces and illustrations that mimic clay, as the name implies, being a natural progression of Corporate Memphis.
Since 2023, there has been a noticeable decline for Flat Design, most notably with the rebranding of Android and Reddit, with their respective mascots Bugdroid and Snoo. And in the case of Reddit, the app/website also started adopting the aesthetic in their illustrations, like in the 2023 Recap and achievements page. In 2024, Apple released the Apple Vision Pro, which heavily utilizes Glassmorphism throughout the UI, facilitating the visualization of interfaces in Augmented Reality (AR). It's likely that Cybermorphism will fully replace Flat Design as the new major design aesthetic at some point around 2026-2027. Cybermorphism's visual motifs are:
Glassmorphism incorporates elements from other aesthetics such as Frutiger Aero's ""aero"" glass, and shiny translucent effects. It also borrows from the simplicity of Flat Design, while incorporating elements that make use of gentle forms and soft edges, sometimes combined with muted lights and subtle shadows. In contrast to the muted and minimalistic tendencies of Flat Design, Glassmorphism adopts a diverse range of colors, a more humanistic interface, and frosted/translucent transparency effects. Wallpaper designs within the Glassmorphic realm tend to be simple, abstract, and colorful, as seen in Xiaomi, Huawei, Samsung and the latest builds of iOS and macOS.
Neumorphism is a design style that combines the realistic feel of Skeuomorphism, the simplicity of Flat Design, and the futuristic and glossy look of Frutiger Aero. It retains many qualities of Skeuomorphism and Flat Design but is fundamentally different because of its depth and accessibility. Neumorphism's elements blend into the background, makes use of gentle forms and soft edges, sometimes combined with muted lights and subtle shadows. This creates a unique visual experience that is both futuristic and familiar. It's characterized by a sense of depth and accessibility, as well as a focus on simplicity and ease of use. The term ""Neumorphism"" was coined in 2019 by Jason Kelly, as a portmanteau of ""neo"" and ""skeuomorphism"", emphasizing the trend as a modern revival of Skeuomorphism.
Claymorphism focus on 3D visuals that attempt to replicate the texture of clay, which is often achieved by using smooth and blob-like shapes, soft shading, and pastel colors, creating something that is welcoming and accessible to general audiences. This style is commonly used in illustrations for advertisement, depicting people's diversity and everyday life, making Claymorphism a natural evolution of Corporate Memphis, by taking it to a new dimension and with a greater level of detail.",2010s (Early roots)2020s (Realized aesthetic),Microsoft's Fluent 2 illustrations (2024),"Smooth 3D objects, glass textures, depth, shadows, rounded corners, gradients","White, Black, Gray, Pastels",
Cyberspace Webrooms,https://aesthetics.fandom.com/wiki/Cyberspace_Webrooms,"Cyberspace Webrooms is an aesthetic that centers around Online Virtual Worlds[1] from the 90s-2000s. It is a subgenre of Old Web, Y2K Futurism, and Frutiger Aero and as a result, shares many similarities with them. It is characterized by skeuomorphism, kid-friendly interfaces, common setting of malls, schools, streets, low-poly 3D models and in general, the online worlds they take place in. The first virtual worlds came in the form of chat rooms where the world was described exclusively through text, and this notably included MUDs (multi-user dimension/dungeon) or MUSHs, the later abbreviation being disputed The first MUD was created in 1978 by Roy Trubshaw and Richard Bartle at Essex University.

Neopets was created by then college students Donna Williams and Adam Powell, and launched in 1999 as the first big browser-based virtual pet site which developed into a fully fledged virtual world with social aspects such as the ability to customize profiles and message boards.[6] The popularity of Neopets spawned several virtual pet sites which range in being more heavily based on Neopets, such as Marapets and Subeta both created in 2004. Virtual pet sites as a genre has since expanded to include a variety of unique games with some being focused on the creature collecting like Chicken Smoothie or some being based on the simulation aspects like Lioden.
Webkinz got its start in 2005 as one of the first big toys to life games where players would adopt a stuffed animal with a code that would grant them access to the online game.[7] Its success would spawn other browser-based toys to like games, such as U.B.

Danish Pastel,https://aesthetics.fandom.com/wiki/Danish_Pastel,"Danish Pastel is an interior and graphic design aesthetic that became popular among Gen Z in the 2020s, specifically on TikTok, Instagram, and Pinterest. It is characterized by having pastel, Scandinavian furniture and accessories against naturally lit white rooms. Like other TikTok interior design aesthetics, certain products and designs have become iconic and are featured in almost every iteration of the aesthetic.
The aesthetic's visuals are somewhat of a continuation of the simplistic and sophisticated Scandinavian design, which dominated Western interior design in the 2010s, albeit with an added affinity for color and with a less minimalistic approach. This reflects Generation Z's embrace of all things maximalist, which can be seen in the asymmetrical decorations, bold color combinations and eye-catching patterns utilised. Much of the aesthetic takes inspiration from modern art that emphasizes shapes in flat colors, such as from Matisse and Picasso.
Danish Pastel is an interior design aesthetic, so there is a strong emphasis on products centered around decorating and furnishing a home. The photos in the aesthetic largely center around collections of items that create a pleasing color palette of brightly-colored pastels, often contrasting white walls and furniture.

Dark Academia,https://aesthetics.fandom.com/wiki/Dark_Academia,"Dark Academia is a popular (and the original) academic aesthetic that revolves around classic literature, the pursuit of self-discovery, and a general passion for knowledge and learning. Because this is an internet aesthetic, it largely entails sharing photographs, making outfits, and participating in certain hobbies through social media.

As the internet aesthetic grew in the late 2010s and early 2020s, many book publishers capitalized on this aesthetic and used this phrase to create and advertise YA books, making this also a new fictional microgenre in its early stages.

Dark Academia's visuals stem primarily from upper-class European cultures of the 19th century, Gothicism, and American Prep. The upper class of this time period(and to an extent today as well along the Old Money) emphasized a liberal education in which Latin, rhetoric, and classics were taught subjects. These are now seen as unusual and esoteric, creating an allure that presents schooling as not dreary or boring, but one that cultivates mystery, curiosity, and diligence that isn't commonly seen in contemporary schooling.

Because of this allure of intelligence and mystery, being pretentious is celebrated within the Dark Academia community. Romanticizing education and moments in life related to university experiences is the core appeal of the aesthetic, with grandiose statements and wishes for success being common text post subjects.

Other than the appreciation of learning, Dark Academia includes motifs of criminality and danger. Secret societies, cults and murder are common subjects within the aesthetic. Characters within the works of fiction associated with Dark Academia, specifically The Secret History and Kill Your Darlings, live decadent and self-destructive lifestyles involving drugs, moments of intense violence, and secrets. This is similar to the darker side of the Old Money aesthetic as well as Dark Royaltycore.

People who use this aesthetic are sometimes referred to as Dark Academics. However, ""academic"" typically refers to researchers and professors, while Dark Academia fans do not usually have recognized credentials or an academic background. Dedicated fans of the aesthetic may craft a persona based on the characters and suggestions of the aesthetic, often pursuing an academic career, though of course, such personae don't reflect the actual career and environment of academia.","mid 2010s, popularized in 2020",,"Books, history, literature, novels, reading and writing, mystery, old buildings, old money

Sometimes this meme aesthetic also uses elements of dark humor, such as racist jokes and slurs, which has led to controversy (See the Criticism section).

Doomer,https://aesthetics.fandom.com/wiki/Doomer,"Doomer, also called Doomerwave when referring to its aesthetic, is an internet subculture based around urbanism and other global problems (war, economy, climate change, the end of the world, etc.) seen from a pessimistic and nihilistic point of view, typically focused in east Slavic countries (Russia, Ukraine and Belarus), although it's not necessarily limited to these nations. The aesthetic usually depicts lifeless and cold images of urban scenery in eastern Europe (particularly Brutalist architecture and Khrushchevka buildings) and a sense of disillusionment for the current state of the world. These types of images are usually edited with depressing filters (like old tapes, vintage or gloomy filters) and music genres like Post-Punk, Synthpop, Synthwave, Shoegaze, etc. The signature character associated with this aesthetic is the ""Doomer"", a Wojak meme character originating from 4chan. The Doomer is depicted as an hopeless adult man who deals with problems like depression and opioid addiction. The Doomer aesthetic sometimes also includes anti-war topics, particularly relating to the Russian invasion of Ukraine, showing images of devastated places.
Some visuals prominent in the Doomer aesthetic include:
Doomer is not only a subculture but also a global general way of thinking. In fact, the term ""Doomer"" was used as early as 2008 by the Peaknik community, which essentially consists of people who believe in the Peak Oil conspiracy theory[1]. Later, exactly one decade later, in 2018, various 4chan users started making Wojak memes out of various characters ending in ""-oomer"" (referencing the term ""boomer""). Among them, there was a character called ""The Doomer"", which gained traction on social media platforms due to its melancholic nature. The internet subculture spawned after this meme was characterized by a dark and hopeless interpretation of the world and modern society, and those who describe themselves as ""Doomers"" express this through their music taste, ideology, fashion, and aesthetic pictures. Essentially, the four main emotions associated with the Doomer subculture are alienation, pessimism, nihilism and despair. Another key value often found in this subculture is pacifism, as some people have used this aesthetic as a way to cope with the harsh realities of life in war-torn countries.
Doomerwave itself is sometimes described as a microgenre that combines Post-Punk with Vaporwave and Chopped 'n' Screwed music[2]. Doomerwave songs usually consist of sampling Post-Rock or Post-Punk. The samples are slowed down both in speed and pitch, and melancholic elements are added, like record cackles, glitch sound effects and high reverb. Multiple Doomerwave remixes can be found on YouTube and Reddit, where they gained a cult following. Moreover, other than Doomerwave, the Doomer aesthetic is generally associated with a wide number of musical genres. The most predominant music listened by the Doomer community generally includes Post-Punk or Synthpop. However, most songs that have a sad and existential vibe in general can be used in this aesthetic. As described by various members of the community, Doomer songs convey feelings of somber, melancholy and bittersweet emotions[3].
Some musical genres associated with the Doomer subculture include:
The Doomer aesthetic is sometimes criticized for aestheticizing nihilism and depression.

This style came about during the COVID-19 pandemic as a way to uplift people's moods and promote positive energy during quarantine. Eventually this aesthetic has become popular in clothing, interior and visual designs, and has seemed to gain the most traction in China.
Dopamine is said to be the complete opposite of the minimalist style that has been trending in the design industry in the recent years with the heavy use of highly saturated, bright, and vibrant colors, such as yellow, orange, hot pink, and neon green. The colors are supposed to stimulate the brain's nervous system and induce a good mood seeing them. Through color matching bright and lively color segments, Dopamine visuals create a positive atmosphere. Motifs within the aesthetic are usually kept in a simple style and often consist out of fruits and candy that match the primary color of the design or outfit.
When it comes to interior design, the Dopamine style doesn't stick to a traditional home layout and mostly adopts an open design that allows for more flexibility in line with the intention of the aesthetic that's ""creating a comfortable and pleasant living experience"". Besides the importance of color matching. Dopamine also pays great attention to the luster of the materials used and vibrant plastics, glass, and ceramic titles are commonly seen as they reflect light and therefore help create a brighter home atmosphere.

Drain,https://aesthetics.fandom.com/wiki/Drain,"Drain (also known as Drainer - a term referring to people who listen to Drain Gang[1][2]) is an aesthetic and internet subculture that is heavily inspired by the Drain Gang music collective.
The group collective consists of Bladee, Thaiboy Digital, Ecco2K, Whitearmor and Yung Sherman — you can find drain aesthetic images tagged with the member's names. Not only music, they were also the trailblazers in visual sense, fashion and lifestyle. Bladee and Ecco2K, are also visual artists, making most of the group's album covers. In addition, they collaborate with Yung Lean and Sad Boys Entertainment, producing songs together and creating merch designs. The group's music videos are often low-budget, edited and filmed unconventionally and use low resolutions, flashing colors and lights, abrupt cuts as well as custom clip art overlayed with the video.
Drainers gained popularity through the internet, coming off of a wave of post ironic fashion and music enjoyment. The subculture is said to have started on the 4chan boards /fa/ and /mu/ as well as Reddit, back then the subculture was ironic/a meme and probably just a part of Sad Boy culture.
There are some trends that are emphasized by the Drainer subculture:
Musically, Drain Gang has been influential in the genres of trap and sad rap, being early collaborators of the collectives Working On Dying and Goth Money Records. Here's a list of affiliated artists:
The basis for Drain fashion is inspired by the 90s, especially black fashion and hip-hop. Baggy jeans are a huge focus, as well as hoodies/jackets. It has elements of Y2K, 90s Hip-Hop, streetwear, Grunge, and brown and earthy tones in fashion. Around 2023, Drain Gang would begin experimenting with more androgynous/feminine clothing and aesthetics. Many fit pics of Bladee would be edited to be more distorted or heavenly before posting.
Album covers are typified by the heavily distorted collage drawings. Commonly, these experimental, maximalist artworks consist of chroma, cyber overlays, chrome effects, black metal fonts, sparkles, lens flare, and clip art. Their music videos are often low-budget, edited and filmed unconventionally and often using low resolutions, flashing lights/colors, abrupt cuts, as well as custom clip art overlayed with the video, thereby giving off a more amateur-ish and unfamiliar vibe from other artists.

The original Drain aesthetic is much more similar to 90s hip-hop and real Grunge fashion while the visual art made by the fans is heavily feminine, sparkly, and kawaii.
This fan-made drain aesthetic, called Draincore, is best known for its Y2K Futurism-inspired themes. Draincore can be applied to or taking influences from many other aesthetics, including Animecore, Sanriocore, Glitchcore, Weirdcore, and many more.

Dreamcore,https://aesthetics.fandom.com/wiki/Dreamcore,"Dreamcore is a surrealist aesthetic that uses motifs commonly associated with dreams, daydreams or nightmares, portrayed through media such as images, videos and, on occasion, music. Dreamcore shares many similarities with Weirdcore.
These images express feelings of familiarity, anemoia, nostalgia and confusion.
There are multiple originators for the Dreamcore aesthetic. Most are however not inherently based on the same comeliness. In 2012, a YouTube account called ""GlassBeetles"" or ""L0P0A0G"" uploaded videos reminiscent of its motifs such as cryptic texts, hap hazardous oculus placement and Liminal Spaces. They were created by the user Sealtoast. This was the first example of Dreamcore in the video format.
Dreamcore’s exact origins are unknown, the direct origins might be tumblr user ""jaaaaaim"" way back in 2018. It mostly gained popularity in the early-mid 2020s with a surge of TikTok videos containing dreamlike visuals. The videos often include original characters that are typically drawn or stitched together with numerous images. These characters usually have objects for heads.
Dreamcore is commonly portrayed through images and videos, which utilize different 'base images' such as liminal spaces, unrealistic terrain and structures (photoshopped hills, floating buildings, etc.), or even fantasy-like lands, to give the visual a dream-like quality. Dreamcore visuals are typically lighter-toned and pastel in color, or more bright and vivid. These ‘base images’ are then overlaid with different elements, with the major ones being text and characters.
Dreamcore tends to include characters with surreal features. These characters aid in telling a story or creating a scenario that one might possibly see in a dream. They also may include Liminal Spaces. However, the use of characters is not required. Text is also a common element; it ranges from short phrases with very little context to entire conversations or monologues. It’s typically written in a generic base font like Arial, or a serif font like Times New Roman, and can be different colors, sizes and even patterns, depending on what fits the situation best.

Dreamy,https://aesthetics.fandom.com/wiki/Dreamy,"Dreamy is an aesthetic that revolves around dreams. The Dreamy aesthetic can dance between the realms of being somewhat grounded in reality to being so surreal that there's no confusing it with one's state of reality.
Dreamy visuals have a very ethereal vibe, which can either be a ""realistic"" ethereal (which can give it plenty in common with Angelcore or Cloudcore) or a ""surreal"" ethereal (which can give it plenty in common with either Synthwave or Vaporwave), but shares a lot in common with the Lo-Fi aesthetic (which has a similarly hazy vibe to it). What differentiates the two, however, is Lo-Fi deals almost exclusively with the waking world, Dreamy deals strictly with the ""sleeping"" world.
Among the many ""dreamy"" styles of music, the most noteworthy is Dream Pop, a subgenre of alternative rock and neo-psychedelia that grew out of ethereal wave/darkwave and developed in the 1980s. The style is typified by a preoccupation with sonic texture and atmosphere as much as melody. It often overlaps with the related genre of shoegazing, and the two genre terms have at times been used interchangeably.

Hypnocore is a subgenre of Dreamy that relates to surreality and a sense of being controlled, hypnotized, or otherwise losing one's self-control. In terms of visuals, hypnocore often has spirals, moving patterns, eyes, optical illusions, unreality, deja vu, and an undeniable sense of things being wrong.
There are several ways to engage with hypnocore, just as there are several different views of hypnosis. Hypnocore can be experienced in everyday happenings where one is in a trance of sort, such as when reading, driving, or when half-asleep. A darker version of hypnocore can also be experienced in dreams or nightmares that involve doing out-of-character actions, and dreams where one knows they are dreaming but is unable to wake up. This leads to overlap with Dreamcore.
Feverdream is a subgenre of Dreamy inspired by the thoughts, sounds, sights, feelings, and emotions caused by a fever dream, or an experience similar to one; a dream or nightmare altered by a fever, causing a particularly confusing and bewildering dream at the time, and even more so when remembering it.

Ethereal,https://aesthetics.fandom.com/wiki/Ethereal,"Ethereal is an aesthetic based around the feeling of being extremely delicate and light in a way that seems to be not of this world.
It is typically used in reference to Disney or Barbie princess movies and other fantasy films that are completely without irony in their dreamy romanticism. The imagery used is very wholesome, light, and soft, embracing the happiest parts of fairy tales.
It is a generalization of film imagery that includes depictions of royalty (often princes and princesses), classical dancers, sweeping ballrooms, colorful gardens, pixie dust, fairies, angels, and the beauty of true love. There is a lot of overlap with Cottagecore and Royalcore.

Femcel Weeaboo,https://aesthetics.fandom.com/wiki/Femcel_Weeaboo,"Femcel Weeaboo is an aesthetic and internet subculture that is primarily composed of and depicted by teenage girls who identify as both Femcels and Weeaboos. These young women often turn to anime and manga as forms of escapism from their daily lives, frequently presenting online as mentally ill NEETs (Not in Education, Employment, or Training) without real-life social circles or romantic partners.
However, this aesthetic is mostly an internet persona and doesn't necessarily reflect their offline life. The aesthetic is most commonly found on platforms like Tumblr, TikTok, and Pinterest, where they share images from Japanese media and memes, typically revolving around topics of mental illness and existential dread.
This online subculture is characterized by a very specific taste in anime and music. They frequently identify with and relate to fictional characters with troubled backgrounds or those exhibiting traits of mental disorders. Some examples of media popular within this community include Serial Experiments Lain, Needy Streamer Overload, Evangelion, WataMote, and Puella Magi Madoka Magica. Musically, genres like Indie Rock, Breakcore, and Lolicore are prevalent among femcel weeaboos.
The people that express this aesthetic combine multiple disparate elements that express feminine interests, otaku culture, and depictions of mental illness. For example, a blog may contain things that show a weeaboo lifestyle back-to-back, or in phases. These images tend to be of more candid quality, with the lighting being harsher and more blue, as it is less polished in appearance.
The more kawaii-oriented side of the aesthetic may pair these themes with girly imagery, cursive texts, pink pastels, kawaii mascots like those on Sanrio products, and soft colors. The images posted often are edited with anime girls and male love interests from popular anime.
Due to the popularity of nostalgic 90s anime within the community, art posted in femcel communities tend to have edgier tones attached to a typical cute Moe archetype. Sketchy lines and rendering, harsh black-white contrast, and dark themes (self harm, ero-guro, denpa media, drug use, mental illness, etc.) are added in conjunction with an old school loli-esque art style. This art style is popular amongst Lolicore music artists.
A more recent branch of this aesthetic, often called ""4chancore,"" features exaggerated references to early internet culture, particularly imageboard sites such as 4chan. However, this is despite the fact many Femcel Weeaboos are too young to have experienced these times of the internet firsthand. This behavior is often jokingly referred to as ""LARPing"" (short for Live Action Role-Playing), describing their feelings of anemoia for a bygone era of the internet.
This trend of 4chan-inspired content frequently incorporates anime characters and meme references that were popular in imageboards during the late-2000s. It was popularized by artist ""Lottie,"" also known as ""canihavepromo,"" whose artworks combine 2000s anime with Flash animation styles reminiscent of 4chan. Despite being 16 at the time and never having used 4chan, her depictions were considered remarkably accurate. However, Lottie was eventually deplatformed for her problematic behavior, and other artists copying her art style (known as ""Lottie clones"") have emerged on TikTok.
Arguments against the Femcel Weeaboo aesthetic often overlap with criticism of Waif, though with some distinctions. Both aesthetics are criticized for their toxic depictions of feminity and mental illness, but Femcel Weeaboo tends to focus more on fictional content rather than real-life issues. The discussions surrounding anorexia and eating disorders that are prominent in the Waif community are less prevalent in this aesthetic.
Criticism often revolves around the community's interest in taboo topics, including manipulation, gore, pedophilia, shut-in lifestyles, negative portrayals of schizophrenia, and the more recent obsession with 4chan. For instance, controversies arose on TikTok surrounding Femcel Weeaboos creating catfish accounts and labeling themselves ""IRL lolis."" Loli is a term within Otaku culture used to describe young female anime characters, and it is often considered inappropriate or predatory due to its association with pedophilic content. This ties into the aesthetic's association with Lolicore, a subgenre of Breakcore and J-core music popular within the community, which, while not inherently sexual, can be seen as problematic due to its name.
Another common theme is the depiction of gore, often presented in a style similar to Cutecore. These topics are often used as a form of venting or frustration with trauma. Some have drawn parallels between this and the psycho-erotic horror found in Denpa media and other forms of psychological horror.
The connection between Femcel Weeaboos and the larger, controversial Incel subculture remains loosely defined due to the aesthetic's recent emergence. However, it's worth noting that incels often assert that women cannot experience ""inceldom"" or ""involuntary celibacy,"" which they describe as the state of being unable to find a partner despite desiring one. Thus, they fully exclude women from their community.
The anime and manga watched by this community tends to fall into either a darker tone that is notorious for 90s denpa or psychological horror and the philosophical issues presented in them, or anime that heavily uses moe tropes. Most anime that people of this subculture make memes and jokes featuring characters from is Neon Genesis Evangelion and Serial Experiments Lain, however most anime made in the early 2000's to late 1990's can be featured. The more kawaii-oriented side of the aesthetic features series from shoujo and idol anime, video games and visual novels targeted at girls. These are often from music-related games like Project Sekai or Love Live!, but other series are also popular.",2020s,,"2000s anime, nihilistic phrases/captions, early 4chan references",,

Auroras display dynamic patterns of brilliant lights that appear as curtains, rays, spirals, or dynamic flickers covering the entire sky. Frutiger Aurora emerged in the Early-2000s towards the end of the Y2K Futurism era and maintained it's popularity into the Early-2010s.
Frutiger Aurora first started to appear at the same time as Frutiger Aero. This was near the end of the prominence of the Y2K Futurism aesthetic (c. 1997-2004). Frutiger Aurora's first major appearance was in Mac OS 10, in which it appeared as a series of wallpapers. Frutiger Aurora gained popularity along with Frutiger Aero in the Mid-2000s and lasting into the Early-2010s, mainly in the form of wallpapers as previously seen with Mac OS 10. Microsoft prominently used Frutiger Aurora as part of their ""Windows Aero"" design language; this design language can be seen in Windows Vista and Windows 7.

Frutiger Eco is separated from these aesthetics as it more falls in-line with the visuals and history and of Frutiger Aero. Frutiger Eco's name comes from its father aesthetic, Frutiger Aero, and the prefix (not used as a prefix in this context) ""eco"", meaning ecology or the environment.
For more information, see: Frutiger Aero
Frutiger Eco gained popularity in the Early to Mid-2000s along with Frutiger Aero, both aesthetics utilizing bright and glossy futuristic look to inspire feelings of hope for the future. Frutiger Eco in particular embodied this sentiment using imagery associated with both the future and nature to create a futuristic, utopic feeling. This sense of futuristic eco-friendliness was in response to the growing worries of climate change at the time (these worries still persist today) and Frutiger Eco (along with Frutiger Aero and its sub-aesthetics) aimed to quell these worries and encourage optimism. This led to Frutiger Eco being largely adopted by corporations, its imagery being used to push the values of eco-friendliness and sustainability. During this time, a more corporate version of Frutiger Eco appeared known as Renewable Corporate Futurism.

The Frutiger era succeeded the Y2K Futurism era and preceded the Flat Design era, often being considered the middle ground between the two.
Frutiger Aero itself is increasingly broad leading the internet to assigning subgenres to Frutiger Aero to better understand it and its intricacies. As well as Frutiger Aero subgenres, this category will also list related aesthetics that contributed to Frutiger Aero subgenres' existence, or was popular alongside it.
A Frutiger Aero subgenre is an aesthetic that owes its existence to Frutiger Aero. These are aesthetics that generally follow both the history of Frutiger Aero (emerging in the Mid-2000s, declining during the Early-2010s) and the rough visuals of Frutiger Aero. Examples include: Helvetica Aqua Aero, Frutiger Eco, Dark Aero, and Frutiger Aurora.
There are many aesthetics that are related to Frutiger Aero, but don't directly owe their entire existence to it. These are usually aesthetics that were popular during the same era as Frutiger Aero (c. 2004-2013) that sometimes overlap with it, but are distinct enough visually and historically to be considered a different aesthetic.

The aesthetic of Future Funk takes strong influences from Vaporwave, Animecore and City Pop. Its characterized by its use of 80s and 90s anime imagery, pastel colors, and Retro-like effects.
Visually, as popularized by the YouTube channel Artzie Music, Future Funk visual aesthetics are usually just a looped GIF of a classic anime set to the track (popular animes to utilize are Sailor Moon and Urusei Yatsura, although other classics will pop up like Dragon Ball, Lupin the 3rd, Mobile Suit Gundam, and Macross) so elements of Animecore and Kawaii to the visual aesthetics of Future Funk are extremely common, but it's also not unusual to find aesthetic cues from Vaporwave, Synthwave, and Lo-Fi either.
What is Future Funk?
A tale as old as time: what IS Future Funk?
As stated above, Future Funk takes musical cues from Vaporwave, French House (which gives it some very subtle connections to the poppier entries into the Synthwave genre), Nu-Disco, and Synth Funk to create fun, happy tracks to dance to, taking samples of old funk tracks from the 70's and 80's (bonus points for using Japanese funk music, which is very obscure compared to its American counterparts) and repurposing them in a manner similar to Vaporwave (to the point where Future Funk will often just be lumped in with the genre despite the very clear differences in musical philosophy between Future Funk and Vaporwave.) Future Funk is also heavily influenced by City Pop, Japanese New Wave, and 80s British Synthpop (particularly the likes of Japan the band), and as Future Funk has grown as a genre, these influences have become more pronounced.

Glitch Art,https://aesthetics.fandom.com/wiki/Glitch_Art,"Glitch Art is an art movement that focuses on using digital and analog errors for aesthetic purposes. Glitch art, derived from the word ""glitch"" (from Yiddish גליטש) meaning a sudden malfunction, is a creative practice that intentionally exploits or creates these errors for artistic and aesthetic ends. It is a genre born in the so-called ""Digital Age,"" encompassing visual, auditory, and audiovisual forms.
Glitch art can be achieved through various methods, including digitally corrupting data or physically manipulating electronic devices. This manipulation can range from subtle distortions to dramatic disruptions of the original signal. While Glitchcore, an aesthetic associated with 2020 TikTok, often focuses on the visual style of digital decay, such as bright oversaturated colours and flashing patterns, glitch art explores the artistic possibilities of actual glitches themselves.[1]
While glitch art is a relatively new term, the roots of glitch art can be traced back to early experiments with video and electronic media. Pioneering works like Len Lye's film A Colour Box (1935) and Nam June Paik's video sculpture TV Magnet (1965) show an early fascination with manipulating digital media. Contemporary artists like Cory Arcangel, with works such as Panasonic TH-42PWD8UK Plasma Screen Burn (2007), continue to explore the artistic potential of glitches.
Glitch art, an artistic expression stemming from digital technology's imperfections, has evolved into its own art movement. The term ""glitch,"" originating from the Yiddish word גליטש (glitsh) meaning ""slip"" and entering the English language through the world of web technology, signifies a system malfunction—a visual or auditory anomaly in the realm of technology.[2] These anomalies often manifest as distorted pixels, aberrant colors, or photographic irregularities. Glitch art repurposes these digital accidents as a source of artistic inspiration, intentionally corrupting images to create new forms of visual expression.
Early examples of glitch art, predating the digital age, include Len Lye's 1935 film ""A Colour Box"" and Nam June Paik's 1965 video sculpture ""TV Magnet,"" alongside Jamie Fenton and Raul Zaritsky's 1978 ""Digital TV Dinner."" These works explored signal disruption and electronic manipulation, laying the groundwork for later works.
The rise of accessible computers in the 1990s and early 2000s provided artists with new tools. Artists began intentionally corrupting digital files and manipulating media, leading to unexpected visual results. The term ""glitch"" became associated with experimental electronic music in the mid-1990s, later extending to visual arts as artists embraced the aesthetic of the digital age. The net.art movement, including the Dutch-Belgian art collective JODI (Joan Heemskerk and Dirk Paesmans), explored intentional website errors to reveal underlying code. This influenced later distortion techniques like databending and datamoshing.
Rosa Menkman's work examines visual artifacts from data compression and digital errors, solidifying glitch art as a distinct art genre. Yasunao Tone's ""wounded"" CDs, created by scratching their surface, challenged audio norms. Glitch art's influence expanded into mainstream media, particularly music videos, during the 2000s. Contemporary artists like Phillip Stearns, Sabrina Ratté, and Kim Asendorf work across various mediums, combining traditional techniques with glitch processes. Social media platforms have also facilitated a global community of glitch artists.
Glitch art's history is connected to avant-garde movements such as Dadaism and Futurism, which embraced experimentation and technology. It challenges established aesthetics by using errors and glitches, embracing imperfection as part of the artistic process. Cory Arcangel's 2007 piece ""Panasonic TH-42PWD8UK Plasma Screen Burn"" exemplifies contemporary glitch art. Glitch art is all about the imperfect nature of the digital world, intended to cause viewers to reflect on the underlying technologies and processes that create and transmit digital information.[3]
In glitch art, a ""glitch"" typically refers to a digital or analog error that produces visual distortions. Glitch artists utilize these errors as a creative tool, generating visual anomalies such as pixelation, color shifts, and unexpected patterns. These effects, which would otherwise be perceived as flaws, are embraced by glitch artists as a means of artistic expression. Visual motifs are created through various methods. One approach is data manipulation (databending), which involves directly altering the code of an image, video, or audio file using tools like hex editors. This can result in unpredictable and often surprising visual or auditory outputs.
Another technique is datamoshing, primarily used in videos. This involves manipulating compressed video data, often by selectively removing or altering I-frames (key frames). This creates a cascade of visual distortions as subsequent frames attempt to reconstruct the missing information.
Misalignment occurs when a file is opened with software not intended for its format. For example, opening an image file in an audio editor can lead to unexpected visual interpretations of the data.
Hardware failure can also be a source of glitch art visuals. This involves physically manipulating hardware, such as through circuit bending, to generate visual or auditory glitches. This might include short-circuiting connections or physically altering devices to produce unexpected outputs.
Misregistration refers to the use of physical imperfections on analog media, like scratches on film or vinyl, to create visual or auditory distortions during playback.
Distortion encompasses a range of techniques that introduce visual distortion. Early examples include Nam June Paik's use of magnets to distort television signals. Digital distortion techniques include manipulating compression algorithms or intentionally introducing artifacts.
Common visual effects in glitch art include pixelation, where an image is broken down into larger blocks of pixels; color shifts, which involve sudden and unexpected changes in color; pattern breakup, where regular patterns in an image are disrupted; static and noise, which introduce visual noise or static; and compression artifacts, which are the visual distortions created by lossy compression. Glitchcore, an aesthetic popularized on Tiktok during 2020, derives some inspiration from glitch art's visual style. Glitchcore frequently centers on the aesthetic of glitches rather than the technical methods used to create them.
Glitchcore visuals commonly include bright, contrasting colors, rainbows, rapid transitions and cuts, distorted images and effects, and themes of chaos, eyestrain, and digital overload. In contrast to glitch art's use of technical and conceptual aspects of digital errors, Glitchcore only employs the visual language of glitches to establish its own aesthetic identity. It often integrates elements of internet culture, anime, memes, and hyperpop music.
Some consider Glitchcore to be Gen Z's own interpretation of glitch art, influenced by the isolation of the COVID-19 pandemic, accessible digital editing tools, and the rapid pace of social media.[5] The distinction lies in the community, intention, and focus. Glitch art often examines the technical and conceptual facets of glitches, with clear organizations, events, and artists, whereas Glitchcore is a TikTok-centric phenomenon and primarily utilizes the visual style of glitches for aesthetic expression.
Glitch artists utilize these various techniques and effects to explore new artistic possibilities and challenge the traditional conventions of art. They embrace the unexpected and unpredictable nature of glitches, transforming them into a form of artistic expression.
""One good example is my 2008 series of digital artworks entitled After Abu Ghraib. At the time I was working extensively with corrupted jpg files. This was before Glitch. I was unaware of other artists working this way, but there must have been. To corrupt an image, I would open a jpg as a txt. file, recode the txt. file, re-save it as a jpg. When I opened it again it would corrupt. I never knew how it would end up, which is what made it fun, and reminiscent of action painting, which has always informed my digital work. The corrupted image was a starting point allowing for tremendous visual possibility, and I would use this process in many other series. The “txt. to jpg.” method only worked on much older operating systems. Nowadays I use glitch and glitchshop.""
― Clayton Campbell
Similar to Vaporwave, some interpret Glitch Art as a form of critique of capitalism, exposing the fragility of technology-driven systems and the potential for disruption and decay inherent in digital media. By revealing the ""errors"" hidden beneath the surface of polished digital interfaces, glitch art can be seen as a challenge to the pursuit of technological perfection and the consumerist drive for flawless products.
Glitch art has been presented in numerous exhibitions and events around the world, ranging from early gatherings of artists to established festivals and online showcases.

Most of the things that are involved with grandparentcore are old, vintage, or even antique as it is implied that they have been used or were invented a long time ago. This aesthetic is split into two different aesthetics: Grandmacore and Grandpacore.

Grime Art,https://aesthetics.fandom.com/wiki/Grime_Art,"Grime Art is a form of digital art stylized to look dark, gritty and grotesque, which yet manages to appeal to the general public. The aesthetic focuses on transforming pre-existing pictures (particularly portraits and selfies, among other imagery) into cartoonish, disfigured and ""zombified"" versions of the original photo, using elements such as dripping faces, exaggerated facial features and non-natural skin colors. This aesthetic particularly became popular during 2015-2018, being mostly associated with Rap, Hip-Hop and Horrorcore Rap music.  
The general appeal of Grime Art lies in its ability to be in some way ""relatable"" due to its imperfect grotesque style. By distorting, deforming and drawing over familiar images, Grime artists aim to create a sense of unease and provoke thoughts on the viewers.
Grime Art shares many similiarities with Caricaturism, which can date back to as early as the Medieval period, as many artists have been experimenting with distorsion since those times. Grotesque art in particular has been a creative interest of a minority of people since the Classical era, but modern variants have gained important attention in the Internet and social media. The appeal of Grotesque art in general mainly comes from how the grotesque is a common experience, yrt an overlooked and stigmatized one, so somehow it can be relatable to many people. Given all of this, the original idea of Grime Art is that art doesn't necessarily need to be ideal, perfect or ""palatable"".
The creation of Grime Art is attributed to Richie Velasquez, more known as deladeso online[1]. Despite this, this aesthetic started to spread after the music video for the Dubstep song ""Head Splitter"" by Getter became an hit in 2015, back when the Dubstep genre was at its peak[2]. The musical video featured Grime Art visuals as well as some Vaporwave elements. Eventually, Grime Art was picked up as a new trend by many artists in social media sites, like Instagram, Tumblr or PicsArt, where an entire challenge based around Grime Art was hosted in 2018[3]. A community of Grime artists started appearing in those platforms, and it progressivily became less repetitive. Despite the fact it was initially associated with Dubstep, it also moved on into other musical genres, including Rap, Hip-Hop and Horrorcore.
The visuals of Grime Art are quite simple. Although they originally were used on musical videos, nowadays they're more used in portrait edits and other paintings. Grime Art is usually made by drawing over pre-existing images and adding Grotesque elements, like drip, slime, pepperoni pizza, zombies, melting flesh, vomit and white glowing eyes. It also often includes other elements deemed ""imperfect"" regarding personal appareance, like droopy skin and exaggerated eyebags. As part of its zombie-oriented style, the edits also often include skin colours that are not natural, like pink, light red, blue, green, purple or yellow, and the tones are usually either pastel or bright. Some consider this style to be repetitive, but some dedicated Grime artists like Richie Velasquez have tried to make less repetitive artworks by incorporating and experimenting with new elements.",Mid-2010s,,"Drip, pizza, slime, puke, exaggerated facial expressions, white eyes, zombies",Any (bright and pastel),
Hacker,https://aesthetics.fandom.com/wiki/Hacker,"The Hacker aesthetic is based around computer hacking, a term for utilizing computers through non-standard means, and the corresponding subculture of Hacker culture built around it. Hacker culture abides by a philosophy known as ""Hacker ethic"", based around the idea of freedom of information. Hacker aesthetic is closely related to Old Web, with hackers idealizing the freedom of the old internet and rejecting the corporatization of it.
The term ""Hacker"" originated in the 1960s in technology academia. Hacker culture developed parallel at campuses such as the the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and Carnegie Mellon University. With the invention of the internet, hacker culture was able to become much more widespread as computer hobbyists could meet online from across the country. Hacker culture can be considered to be the first internet aesthetic.
Computer setups often in dimly lit rooms, filled with electronics such as keyboards, monitors, CDs. An example is Neo's apartment from The Matrix. This part of the aesthetic is similar to Web Creep with the same elements of disorganized wires and electronics strewn about.
Elements of Glitchcore are often seen.
Green terminal screens filled with falling computer code (referred to as ""Digital Rain"") originated from The Matrix and have become a popular visual of the aesthetic.
The anonymous mask is a symbol of anonymity and resistance commonly associated with hackers and the loose hacker collective labeled Anonymous. It originated from the Guy Fawkes mask from the graphic novel and movie V for Vendetta. The mask soared in popularity as it was handed out in a marketing stunt for the movie[1], and then became a symbol for Anonymous after its members decided to adopt the mask for a protest against the Church of Scientology called ""Project Chanology"".

Art created using ASCII characters and symbols, similar to the way words are written in Leetspeak. There are many techniques and styles of ASCII art. Crackers are known for using ASCII art logos in the nfo files of their releases.
A table of Leetspeak numbers and combinations to replace letters.
Leetspeak, also known as leet (written as ""1337""), is a pseudo-language used online by hackers. It is based around a system of modified spellings that replaces words with a resembling combination of numbers, signs and symbols. For example, the word Hacker becomes Haxor (H4x0r) and Elite becomes Leet (1337).
Leetspeak is a way to bypass text filters as well as an argot (a language designed to prevent outsiders from understanding). It developed various 'dialects' on different internet forums as the symbols used for substitutions varied. Leetspeak is not used anymore by hackers for the most part, due to text filters improving over the years, and non-technical users now use leetspeak. However, it has been adopted by Scene members.
Black Hat Hackers are hackers who practice unethical Hacking and violate the law when they hack. Some examples of crimes commited by Black Hats include spreading malware, ransomware and spyware, stealing data, breaching websites and stealing financial information and personal information. Black Hat Hackers are the most stereotypical and well known variant of Hackers due to their bad reputation and representation in the media. The concept of ""Black Hat"" and ""White Hat"" hackers references Western movies from the 1950s, when the bad guys would wear black hats and the good guys would wear white hats.
Grey Hat Hackers are a type of hackers who are experts at cybersecurity and computer hacking, but sometimes break the typical ethical standards when they practice it. However, contrary to Black Hat Hackers, they don't always have malicious intentions.
Red Hat Hackers are hackers who enjoy picking up fights with Black Hat Hackers and defending victims and innocent people. They may also use hacking to spread social, political, religious or ideological messages and activism and bypass governmental dictatorships.
White Hat Hackers, also known as Ethical Hackers, are a type of hackers who practice hacking for ethical reasons, such as testing and spotting errors, bugs or loopholes on websites, and spot vulnerabilities and security issues online. White Hat Hackers usually only hack if they have the consent to do so by the owners of the respective websites.
Skids, otherwise known as Script Kiddies or Wannabe Hackers, are a subcategory of 'Hackers' characterized by being beginners at hacking or exploiting. They are often judged by the Hacker community due to their inability to program, and the way they take codes and scripts made by other people and claim it as theirs and don't give credit to their respective creators. They are often young and unskilled and use third party hacking resources for malicious intentions because they want to be like Black Hat Hackers. They are also known to enjoy vandalizing websites or ruining online videogames for people and use cheap or free programs to do so. Skids are usually found on online videogames and social media websites such as Roblox, Fortnite, Discord or V3rmillion. Skids usually grow up to be White Hat Hackers, have another non-cybersecurity computer job, or abandon computer science altogether. Only in rare cases to script kiddies become black hat hackers.
Social Engineering or Human Hacking is a type of non-computer hacking of tricking and scamming people into giving away their credentials. Such attempts at hacking include lying and impersonation. For example, sending scam messages to people and pretending to be part of important organizations such as the government or a bank, so the victim gets tricked into giving away their personal information. As Social Engineering is by definition not computer hacking, Social Engineers who claim to be true hackers are often frowned upon in the Hacker community because many Hackers believe Social Engineering doesn't count as true hacking, although many hackers know how to engage in social engineering.",1960s,"Neo's Apartment from The Matrix

Helvetica Aqua Aero,https://aesthetics.fandom.com/wiki/Helvetica_Aqua_Aero,"Helvetica Aqua Aero (also known as Frutiger Aqua, Aquacore, Low Frutiger, or simply Helvetica Aqua) is a Frutiger Aero sub-genre characterized by its use of imagery related to tropical water habitats. Common motifs include aqua life, bubbles, water, aquatic colors and other key elements of the ocean. Helvetica Aqua combines this with shared elements of Tropicalcore and Frutiger Aero such as gloss, futurism, 3D rendered objects, gradients, as well as tropical and aquatic themes which create a midpoint between the two.
The visuals for Helvetica Aqua is imagery related to the sea, the ocean, and beach environments. This aesthetic often features common aquatic creatures such as fish, dolphins, and whales, but seagulls and butterflies are used as well similar to Frutiger Aero. The colors used in this aesthetic are often shades of blue, green and yellow, evoking the colors of its inhabitants and seascape. This is combined with shared elements of Tropicalcore and Frutiger Aero such as glassy textures, gradients, fish, and other tropical imagery. Other common motifs include sandy beaches, palm trees, and seashells. Helvetica Aqua is considered a sub-genre to Tropicalcore due to the fact that they are both centered around the sea and aquatic life, while also using the same visuals and presentation style as Frutiger Aero at the same time.
Unedited or unaltered pictures of the ocean are NOT Helvetica Aqua. Similar to Frutiger Aero and Y2K Futurism, it is typical for an image or piece of media classified as Helvetica Aqua to be edited in some way or include CGI.
Apple's Aqua UI Theme (debuted 2000)
Helvetica Aqua originated in the Early-2000s following the decline of Y2K Futurism and the rise of Frutiger Aero. It likely gets its namesake from Apple's Aqua UI, similarly to Frutiger Aero and Metro's namesakes coming from the design language used in Windows 7 and Windows 8, respectively. Due to its dreamy, aquatic, gloss based visuals, Helvetica Aqua was incredibly child friendly, being implemented in products and locations for young children during its time, such as children's hospitals or toys. Helvetica Aqua was also utilized in the Corporate scene, featuring sleeker and cleaner visuals, as well as utopic and joy-themed imagery.
Helvetica Aqua lasted into the Late-2000s and began to lose its mainstream popularity in the Early-2010s. During its decline, the more corporate side of Helvetica Aqua was more prominent than the variant marketed towards children with the 'anything goes' mindset; this was due to the Y2K influence being phased out as the years passed. By 2013, Frutiger Aero was in decline, and by 2017, Flat Design became the dominant design philosophy of its era.",2000s,,"Ocean, Shore, Fish, Bubbles, Water, Waves, Coral Reefs, Rainbows, & Other beach environment elements","Vibrant colors; Blue, Teal, Lime Green, Aquamarine, Yellow",

Hermaphroditus was the son of Hermes and Aphrodite. Ovid's account relates that Hermaphroditus was nursed by naiads in the caves of Mount Ida, a sacred mountain in Phrygia (present day Turkey). At the age of fifteen, he grew bored with his surroundings and traveled to the cities of Lycia and Caria. It was in the woods of Caria, near Halicarnassus (modern Bodrum, Turkey) that he encounters the nymph Salmakis, who was overcome in lust for him. She tries to seduce him, but he rejected her. Shortly after, Hermaphroditus was bathing in a pool, when Salmacis, who was secretly watching him, jumped into it close to him, and asked the gods to unite them in only one body. From there, he becomes an androgynous being, usually represented as a woman with male genitalia.

HexD,https://aesthetics.fandom.com/wiki/HexD,"HexD is a microgenre that originated in the late 2010s, pioneered by the music collective Hexcastcrew. The genre is characterized by its bitcrushed lo-bit sound, sometimes drawing inspiration from nightcore by speeding up and high pitching songs, especially through remixes and samples.[1][2] It typically encompasses atypical examples of cloud rap or trance music. It began to take on more prominence when one of the members of Hexcastcrew, Stacy Minajj, released his DJ Mix Rare RCB hexD.mp3 in June 2019.[3]
HexD music can be split in two branches based on their influences: Surge (also known as Crushed Trap), which is the original hip-hop and cloud rap-oriented musical style, and Sextrance (also known as Crushed Trance), a more recent derivative genre associated with trance music and other subgenres of electronic dance music.
The visual style associated with HexD is generally used on cover arts and music videos, focusing on a low-quality, dirty and melancholic aesthetic that evokes nostalgia, mainly for the mid-to-late 2000s. It incorporates heavily edited and compressed images, photos of (primarily) female anime characters, references to 2000s gaming culture, symbols such as the Star of David or demonic sigils, and inspiration from styles and subcultures like Emo, Scene, Blingeecore, and Frutiger Aero.
Closely related microgenres with a very similar aesthetic include Sigilkore, Xpiritualism, and Krushclub (all of which might aesthetically or musically overlap with each other to some extent).
HexD originated when various Experimental Hip-Hop and Cloud Rap artists formed a musical group called Hexcastcrew in 2019. This group was characterized by using an audio effect known as Bitcrush or Bitcrushing, which gave the tracks an old, sloppy lo-fi sound, plus the voices of the rappers of the group used to be altered to have a pitch higher than usual. This would give these songs a mysterious, ethereal and intriguing touch. The genre used to be quite niche and obscure at one point, but it wasn't until one of the group's members, tomoe_✧theundy1ng, better known as Stacy Minajj, released his DJ mix Rare RCB hexD.mp3, that the genre would take more notoriety within the community of underground rappers and hip hop artists on SoundCloud. The aforementioned DJ mix was a collection of remixed songs from another Cloud rap group known as Reptilian Club Boyz (RCB); these songs were remixed in the style of HexD, with lo-fi and bitcrushing effects, sped up tracks, and altered pitch.
At the beginning, HexD was just another style within hip hop and was limited only to subgenres of hip hop, but slowly, the genre would begin to evolve and merge with other musical styles, specifically artists like Sienna Sleep and Exodia who would mix HexD with trance, Freeform hardcore, and other EDM styles resulting in Sextrance as a result of this multiple genre combination. Besides Sextrance, HexD has served as the basis and insipiration for other musical genres, the most popular ones being Krushclub and Sigilkore, which share similar sound and visual style bases.",Late-2010s,"Cover art for ""Rare RCB Hexd.mp3""","Compressed images, video games, anime characters, pixel art, Old Web graphics, distortion, Blingee GIFs, blood, the Star of David, vampiric and demonic references","White, pink, purple, black, holographic colors",

Despite being nearly limitless in its potential expression due to the nature of human imagination, Imaginarium tends to lean towards a somewhat abstract, highly colorful theme. The aesthetic combines many different elements, making it more visually interesting and especially appealing to younger demographics.
Though not inherently childish or aimed at children, Imaginarium does take on many childlike qualities, such as the use of playroom-type environments, vibrant colors and well-known fantastical motifs. Often illustrated as a dream-like world that exists parallel to our own or simply as a creative addition to everyday life, this aesthetic is mainly based on alternative interpretation and recombination of existing themes in a playful, lighthearted way, similar to that of a pleasant surreal dream. Imaginarium has no ties to any particular medium, setting or form of expression while still being largely reliant on familiar, recognizable concepts, separating it from similar aesthetics such as Craftcore, Kidcore or Psychedelia.
Imaginarium is versatile, and thus allows for exploration of somewhat darker and creepier themes within its realm while still maintaining an intriguing, creative atmosphere. Examples of this can be seen with one of (PSVita) Little Big Planet's in-game locations called the ""Spooky Mansion"".
Note that while this aesthetic can be used in interpretation of psychedelic experiences, it is primarily meant to represent the creative wanderings of a sober mind.
Imaginarium's visual contents can be nearly limitless in the right context, making the creation of a definitive list practically impossible. However, some of the most common/generally recognized visuals include:
Themes, in this case, represent a general set of core ideas, the ""mechanism"" through which Imaginarium manifests itself in media. 
These mainly include:
As with visuals, Imaginarium's fashion relies mainly on way of presentation rather than a strict set of items. Anything can fall under this definition, given use of the correct themes and imagery.

This differs from other forms of Kawaii in that it contains specific merchandise, room decor, and fashion trends that are more aligned with the Western interpretation of Kawaii, as opposed to actual Japanese Kawaii fashions, similar to what is seen in Cutecore.
The objects common in the aesthetic are incredibly replicated, and the aesthetic is shown in TikToks that are dedicated to showing the set-ups of a kawaii gamer. While the aesthetic requires a large quantity of merchandise (as maximalism is common), it is more accessible and casual than actual J-fashion due to the rise of Kawaii culture globally and the increased e-commerce and commercialization of media properties. Kawaii Gamer Girl fashion and visuals are highly inspired by the Erokawa, Babygirl, Soft Girl, Animecore, and Neko aesthetics.
Some women in this aesthetic put on the persona of a ""gamer girl,"" where they advertise their love for video games, have a cute physical appearance, and bubbly personality through making TikTok videos and content on Twitch and YouTube. There are also some women who incorporate this aesthetic into their sexual presentation, related to the Babygirl aesthetic. Others focus exclusively on room decor/electronics, unboxing merchandise, and collecting inspiration and do not show themselves on camera.
These people, typically women, are expressing their femininity and love for these certain characters in a hobby that is traditionally dominated by men and male aesthetics. For example, most gaming merch is in black and red with aggressively sleek detailing, which isn't palatable for many girly girls. Kawaii gaming aesthetics would thus allow women interested in video gaming to have their own community where they do not have to sacrifice their femininity for their hobbies.
Some Kawaii Gamers also focus on breaking the idea of there being a difference between ""real"" games and ""girly"" games, as many people (especially men) believe that more action and competition-driven games are superior to ones with lower stakes.
One notable influence on this aesthetic is the E-Girl, who was also influenced by Kawaii culture but more involved with darker alt aesthetics. Some E-Girl, as well as Soft Girl, make-up and fashion trends, such as tennis skirts, heavy blush, and long dyed hair (often in wigs), influenced the outward appearance and gender performance of a Kawaii Gamer.
The earlier Erokawa aesthetic in Japan also had a huge influence on this aesthetic, particularly the more mature, Babygirl-related side.
The aesthetic can take on a Yume Kawaii palette of pastels and white, rainbow, or more purple and blue neon, although there are many color variations on the aesthetic, such as Mizuiro.
Of course, Kawaii Gamers tend to show their love for both their passions through combining the two. Technology for gaming in pink and white accents, such as PCs, Nintendo DS, and Switches are the most shown photo subject and is most representative of this interpretation of kawaii. Customized keyboards with decorative keys in multiple colors are one of the entry points into the aesthetic due to their accessibility and variety of models and key caps, such as glowing lights, paw prints, and different colors and fonts for the display.
Displays on computer home pages and social media are also important to the aesthetic. Admirers of the aesthetic customize backgrounds of PCs, mouse pads, social media icons and headers, and phone lock screens to fan art of their favourite anime characters, Kawaii art, abstract drawings in pastels, etc.
Certain products are iconic and highly sought-after in this community. One of them being the Autofull pink gaming chair with attached bunny ears and a tail, which was popularized by Twitch streamers and gaming YouTubers.[1] Another are cat-ear headphones, which are an example of connecting the Erokawa trope of the anime cat-girl with technology. Most setups also include a cat-paw pillow.
Building off on the inclusion of cat-girls, anime girls and women who display cuteness are extremely popular, especially Nezuko Kamado from Demon Slayer, Sailor Moon, and Chika Fujiwara from Kaguya-sama: Love Is War. This also includes VOCALOID characters such as Hatsune Miku.
In addition to anime characters, mascots are constantly replicated in merchandise created by popular franchises such as Sanrio and Pokémon. Plushies, themed snacks, mouse pads, stationery, etc. of characters such as Pikachu, My Melody, and Hello Kitty clutter the desks of many kawaii enthusiasts, and having affection for a certain mascot is encouraged.
These figurines and plushies are often purchased from subscription boxes, with a comment video format in the community being people opening these products. Similarly, many videos feature Japanese snack openings, where the person on TikTok uploads a video where they arrange Pocky, KitKat, candies, mochi, etc. on a platter from either a subscription box or a haul to an Asian grocery store. Boba and Japanese soda is also popular. Many of these are themed after a certain flavor, such as strawberry or matcha.
For wall decor, a common thing that differentiates this aesthetic from other Kawaii ones is the use of LED or neon lights in pink or purple tubing. This is a general trend in Gen Z gaming and TikTok communities, but this aesthetic incorporates Kawaii shapes such as sakura blossoms or bunny silhouettes.
Sakura motifs are also common in general, as it is connected with Japan and is often featured in anime.
All of these visuals culminate in set-ups, which are the main mode of carrying across the aesthetic. A set-up is the desk space of a gamer and the place where they watch anime, do work, eat snacks, etc. This is why the set-up is the most prioritized place in the aesthetic, as a kawaii gamer would spend most of their time there. The desk would include the electronics, multiple figurines and plushies, walls with lighting and posters, and snacks in a cluttered, yet cozy arrangement that requires a large amount of things.
Typically someone who is in the Kawaii Gamer aesthetic will tend to wear pastel and Kawaii outfits. For example skirts, cute tops, bows, hairclips, and ribbons are common accessories for this aesthetic. Over sized Kawaii jumpers/hoodies with a skirt is also common. Loungefly Sanrio bags are a common bag used by the Kawaii Gamer community, most notably by Nintendo.Grl. More suggestive clothing like mini crop-tops, thigh highs, mini skirts, and chokers, are popular as well.

The music associated with the aesthetic tends to be in the VOCALOID, video game soundtrack, chiptune, Otacore and kawaii Lo-fi genres. These are often cheerful sounding, with electronic beats and sound clips of extremely feminine-voiced women exclaiming something in Japanese.
In addition, some people who admire this aesthetic may be connected with Hallyu and be K-Pop fans.

Men can objectify gamer girls and focus on the persona of their kawaii aesthetic and appearance. Many memes express wanting to have these women as girlfriends to fawn over. Another criticism of Kawaii Gamer may involve the fetishization of East-Asian cultures, which reduces it to an extremely sexualized and commercialized image. This includes stuff like sexualized school uniforms. Many Kawaii Gamers also ""Asianfish"", where a person of another race or ethnicity wears make-up and in some cases, even undergo cosmetic surgery, to look ""East-Asian"". They typically exhibit infantilizing mannerisms (such as puffing out cheeks, having almond shaped eyes, etc.) and perpetuate stereotypes of East-Asian women being seen as ""childlike and submissive"".

Kawaii Warrior,https://aesthetics.fandom.com/wiki/Kawaii_Warrior,"Kawaii Warrior is an aesthetic considered a mixture of Scene, Furry, and Old Emo Art Style. It heavily features bright colors and anthropomorphic animals, and was most popular in the late 2000s and early 2010s, when Sparkledogs were at the height of their popularity. Although confused for Poster Gal, Kawaii Warrior differentiates from Poster Gal due to Kawaii Warrior being more prominent in the late 2000s, having a less nerdy tone, and featuring animal characters extensively, with a few exceptions. This aesthetic has faced a resurgence in recent years, despite it never having truly gone away.

Kidcore/Indie kid,https://aesthetics.fandom.com/wiki/Kidcore,"Kidcore is an aesthetic that centers around bright colors, nostalgia for cultural icons of the 90s, and topics of chilhood. While its origins can be traced back to the 70s-2000s, it appears the aesthetic is a nostalgia-based creation of the 2010s. J-fashion styles, namely Decora, influenced this aesthetic, although Kidcore is less over the top and focuses more on childhood nostalgia and bright colors (Decora is often bright but can be any color scheme). Kidcore differs from Babycore as it is more focused on bright colors, cartoons, nostalgia, toys and accessories, as opposed to soft pastels, stuffies, soft kawaii fashion, and baby items. Both are associated with reclaiming a sense of childhood wonderment. Fairy Kei fashion is sometimes mistakenly called Pastel Kidcore, since it also features retro, nostalgic inspired motifs, but they are in fact different things and Kidcore centers around being bright and not pastel. Kidcore is often confused with Indie Kid, which is a separate aesthetic that was popular around the same time. Kidcore is closely related to Nostalgiacore.
Common motifs in Kidcore visuals are bright colors frequently used on children's toys, most frequently highly saturated versions of the traditional primary colors (red, yellow, and blue), playgrounds, stuffed animals such as Beanie Babies and TY, robot pets like Furbies, Lisa Frank artwork, rainbows, and other kid themes. Other common themes involved in Kidcore include:
Kidcore can also be used in logos, which an example is ""Shayan TV"", in Tatarstan, and Bolajon TV In Uzbekistan.
Kidcore fashion is typically colorful and highly saturated, and predominantly utilizes the traditional primary colors, but it does sometimes include neutrals and secondary colors. Fashion pieces include:
Kidcore is centered around various types of media.
The Aesthetics Wiki staff creates official Spotify playlists for aesthetics, which compile the songs most frequently featured on existing playlists dedicated to those aesthetics. Pages with an official wiki playlist will not include playlists from the public.
The architectural variants of kidcore - known as ""Wonka Post-Modern"", or ""Memphis Jr."" due to it being inspired by the 1980s Memphis aesthetic - predate the rest of the genre, and can be said to have inspired the 2010s popularity via nostalgia. Examples typically come from theme parks and stores which market goods to children such as Toys 'R' Us and Gymboree.
Spooky Kidcore is a subgenre of kidcore that mixes the cute things and bright colors of kidcore with Halloween themes, such as witches, skeletons, and jack-o'-lanterns. It often overlaps with Halloween.
Loudcore is a subgenre of kidcore which revolves around loud, noisy objects and toys that are associated with childhood. Key motifs include bells, fireworks, birthday party-esque or ""school treasure box"" related items, and instruments such as kazoos.
Stickercore is an aesthetic that focuses mainly on children's stickers. Some of the most common types are My Little Pony, Care Bears, Sanrio, Sandylion, and Lisa Frank’s artwork. Anime girls are also seen, but uncommon. The stickers are mostly placed on one's face, but can also go on other parts of the body and objects.
Arcade Kid is a subgenre of kidcore that combines youthful and cute kidcore outfits with video games-related clothes and accessories, like Kirby and Animal Crossing merch. Arcade Kid aesthetic is more colorful and brighter than Arcadecore, which is making it more related to Kidcore.","1970s, 1980s, 1990s, 2000s, 2010s; most modern eras in general",,"Toys, rainbows, nostalgia, reliving childhood","Bright colors, rainbow, pastel, neon",
Korean Cozy Beige,https://aesthetics.fandom.com/wiki/Korean_Cozy_Beige,"Korean Cozy Beige is an aesthetic that describes the aesthetic community in Korea that largely centers around images of domesticity in a neutral color palette with ivory, brown, and beige tones. People in Korea generally post these photos to cohesive Instagram accounts, which later get re-uploaded onto Pinterest.
These images carry across a cozy yet mature tone, with clean and simple compositions. It often has a blog-style component, with Korean residents showing the cafe they went to, events in their life, places they have traveled to, etc.
All the images in the aesthetic have a majority neutral color palette, with beige, ivory, white, and occasionally brown as the primary colors. The lighting in these photos is natural, such as bright and clear sunshine to more muted lighting.
One of the most common photo subjects is of cafes and bakeries, which are very trendy in Korea. Bottled milk tea and coffee, lattes, iced beverages in minimalistic white or clear bottles and cups are often the center focus of the image, and are subject of home cafe videos, which are a popular trend in Korea that teaches viewers how to make fancy drinks at home. All manner of sweets and baked goods, such as croissants, cookies, toast, tiramisu, etc. are also photographed.
Interior design is another common subject, and largely features cozy and neat homes filled with minimalist furniture in neutral colors.

Larpercore,https://aesthetics.fandom.com/wiki/Larpercore,"Larpercore (also known as ""Discord LARP Clans"") is an internet subculture and aesthetic that emerged within underground Discord communities in the early-2020s. Despite its name, it is not related to Live Action Role-Playing (LARP).[Note 2] Instead, ""Larpercore"" describes the phenomenon of individuals adopting extremely edgy and often transgressive online personas within specific, insular online groups. This subculture is characterized by a tightly knit community of individuals organized into semi-formalized and formalized groups, often called ""clans,"" which engage in online disruptive behavior and harassment.
Larpercore groups are often classified in subsets that better describe the activities they engage in; the most notorious ones are ""C-Grade"" and ""Com."" For example, ""C-Grade"" groups often present themselves as ""anti-degenerate"" forces on Discord, aiming to ""cleanse"" the platform of undesirable content. However, their methods frequently involve cyberbullying, coordinated Discord raids, and, in more extreme cases, involvement in activities such as extortion and the distribution of illegal content. This contradiction—presenting as moral crusaders while engaging in harmful behavior—is a defining feature of Larpercore. Members of the groups essentially try to present the most extreme and transgressive online persona, outdoing each other in terms of edginess. More concretely, the subculture has connections to the anti-furry online space, which gained traction on platforms like TikTok as early as 2018.
A notable characteristic of Larpercore is the use of unique identifiers, such as unicode symbols and initials, within usernames (e.g., UЖ, AFF, or AGS). These ""tags"" serve as markers of group affiliation, creating a distinct visual language that is often incomprehensible to outsiders. While some members have abandoned this practice, it remains a prominent feature of the subculture's aesthetic. The use of edgy and shock content, as well as a distinct and often offensive slang, further contributes to the transgressive nature of Larpercore. The subculture is primarily associated with teenage participants. The groups share similar aesthetic and cultural traits despite being separate entities.
Originating from Wikimedia Commons, this ""Police Man Ganson"" image has become intrinsically associated with the UTTP and its affiliated groups, often used in their online activities.
The origins of Larpercore can be traced back to the early 2010s, specifically within the GoAnimate fandom. During this period, internal conflicts within the GoAnimate community led to the emergence of ""anti-troll"" groups. However, these groups were subsequently infiltrated and repurposed by the very trolls they aimed to combat. The ""Cartoon Police Groups,"" designed to symbolically ""arrest"" online trolls, exemplify this trend, with the UTubeTrollPolice (UTTP) being the most notorious example.[1] These groups are readily identifiable by their use of a distinctive police officer clip art, originally sourced as ""Police_man_ganson.svg"" from Wikimedia Commons. The UTTP is alleged to have been founded on February 13th, 2011, by Tommy Parky (also known as Thomas Parkinson or southparkstudiosable), a resident of Liverpool.[2] Over time, these groups have evolved, and are now considered a formative element of Larpercore, having transitioned from mere anti-fandom campaigns on platforms like Google+ and YouTube to the adoption of Discord and increasingly extreme tactics (e.g., social engineering, ragebaiting, distribution of shock content) throughout the 2020s.
While some Larpercore communities may have existed in the late-2010s, particularly around 2019, evidence indicates that the subculture's aesthetic and activity reached a significant peak around 2020, coinciding with the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic and subsequent global lockdowns. This period saw a proliferation of new Larpercore communities on Discord, especially with the ""Project Gachafall"" harassment campaign. Although claims of earlier origins persist, these are often attributed to individuals seeking to exaggerate or boast about their involvement. It is more likely that many of these groups originated as small, informal friend groups or cyberbullying servers, which subsequently expanded into larger, more organized communities.
A FBI sheet table comparing Live Action Role-Play with violent extremism.
Despite its similar and directly derived name, Larpercore is not related to traditional Live Action Role-Playing (LARPing). While the term ""LARPer"" refers to participants in LARP events, within Discord, it is used pejoratively to describe individuals who engage in exaggerated, transgressive online personas. This behavior stems largely from an inflated sense of online influence, coupled with the execution of cyberbullying campaigns that are treated with exaggerated seriousness, akin to large-scale ""conflicts"" against fandoms or perceived cringe culture. Larpercore bears no genuine connection or resemblance to organized LARPing activities. Furthermore, the FBI has released a publication explicitly debunking any link between Live Action Role-Play and violent extremism.[3] This phenomenon has garnered attention on online forums such as Kiwi Farms, notably within the discussion thread titled ""Generation Z, 'Ironic' Degeneracy, Sadism and Discord,"" which has outlined some common elements within this online phenomenon. Another colloquial term used to describe these communities is ""Alphabet Soup Groups,"" poking fun at their penchant for numerous and often obscure acronyms.[4]
Additionally, it's important to note that the term ""Larpercore,"" along with variations like ""Discord Larper,"" is predominantly used externally, often with a derisive connotation. Members typically identify with specific group affiliations rather than the overarching ""Larpercore"" label, which highlights the perceived immaturity and performative nature of their online conduct.
This timeline is a collection of events that increased the public knowledge and perception of groups or events affiliated with Larpercore. It should be noted that, because ""Larpercore"" is an umbrella term and not an unified community, the information available is often focused on the criminal activities of the ""Com"" network, as these activities are more likely to attract media attention than those of ""C-Grade.""
Larpercore is not a single, unified community. It is a umbrella term for various closely related types of online groups. The main factors that connect these groups is the use of Discord as their main platform, and their Discord servers often link back to each other in some way (often through ""alliances""). The original way to classify Larpercore group was the ""Grade System,"" which was created by user YurianHyperGG (UЖ).
C-Grade (short for Coalition; also known as Discord Raiding Community or Clancom) refers to the original Larpercore groups that participate on Discord raids, nuking online spaces, and sharing offensive memes or shock content. Groups affiliated with this subset are often motivated by ""anti-fandom"" or ""anti-degeneracy"" goals, which means they primarily target groups of people they don't like, such as furries or Gacha Life fans. They might describe their groups as ""anti-degenerate,"" ""anti-furry,"" or ""anti-gacha."" The aesthetic used by members of this subset tends to be either try-hard edgy or inspired by imperialistic video games such as HOI4 (overlapping with Wehraboo). The first C-Grade groups existed since at least 2019.
They may also use rare Unicode characters or put ""titles"" that mimic the royalty on their usernames to show everyone how many times they've been banned from the platform (example: someone with ""the 13th"" on their user profile would indicate that they have been banned 12 times).
Examples include:
Cartoon Police Groups (also known as GoAnimate groups, Alphabet Soup groups, or ASG) are a set of closely related groups affiliated with the GoAnimate community. It first originated in 2011 with Thomas Parkinson's UTTP, and was popularized in 2013 with the creation of groups styled after UTTP after their first involvement with the community. characterized by a cartoon police character as their main collective symbol. It is identical to C-Grade in behavior, though they are less likely to use the edgy, imperialist aesthetic associated with C-Grade. Ever since Anime Sucks revived the UTTP in 2023, their practices have become increasingly extreme. However, as of the end of 2024, UTTP operates as a collective of users, no longer active in the mainstream.
Examples include:
Com (also known as Sextortion Com, Extort Com, or Discord™) is the most extreme subset of Larpercore, which originated around 2019. They participate in extortion, persuade young people into self-harm or sending nudes, and spread illegal content and extreme gore videos. Other actions frequently associated with these groups are SIM swapping, OSINT-based doxxing, credential stuffing, database dumping, and creating ""lorebooks"" on Telegram. Aesthetically, they draw inspiration from the Order of Nine Angles, which has led to some news outlets incorrectly associating them with O9A. They don't actually have a clearly defined ideology, primarily motivated by sadism and gaining notoriety within their own circles.
In December 2024, a new term emerged to describe the ""com,"" particularly within the Roblox community through games like ""Da Hood"" and ""Dollhouse Roleplay."" This term, ""com boy,"" refers to players who primarily target young girls, often teenagers, through e-dating. They manipulate these girls into sending them explicit images in exchange for virtual currency, such as Robux or Discord Nitro. If the girl attempts to leave the relationship, the Comboys may resort to blackmail, harassment, and the dissemination of personal information on various online platforms, including Roblox itself. In addition to these actions, some Comboys also engage in ""Skidding,"" the unauthorized use of exploits within Roblox games. While less common, some Comboys may even create their own slogans, which they often include in leaked explicit photos.
Examples include:[Note 3]
The ""recruiting server"" of a group called ""Chaos Gang,"" which has been taken down from the website.
Larpercore communities vary by platform. YouTube tends to have more Anti-Gacha communities, while Anti-Furry communities are more prevalent on TikTok. However, Discord serves as a central hub for all of these groups. They often create temporary ""recruitment"" servers to attract new members for their malicious activities, though these servers are frequently abandoned or banned.
The Larpercore community is fragmented but connected. The users identify with different groups, which they call ""clans"" or ""coms."" However, even if two groups share less-or-more the same values, there have been instances of rivalry and hostility between themselves. Despite this division within Larpercore, almost all of the groups share a common focus on cyberbullying (or alternatively extortion in the ""Com"" subset), insensitive behavior, and similar dark aesthetics with militaristic or political undertones.
Many Larpercore communities exist on Discord, and their servers, though often taken down, are easily found through Disboard tags like ""anti-,"" ""raid,"" ""LARP,"" ""com,"" ""stox,"" or ""semi-toxic."" The level of edginess within these groups varies significantly. Some engage in cyberbullying against teenagers based on hobbies or interests (which is the case of most Anti-Furry groups), while other groups, like AFF or the UTTP, dox children or hack their social media accounts. However, the most extreme groups, such as The Foodists, TSUKI Project,[20] and 764,[21] engage in illegal activities with potential for real-world harm, including but not limited to extorting minors, persuading people into self-harm or suicide, or swatting the families of disabled children. This has led to arrests and surveillance by authorities. Nevertheless, these are only the most extreme cases within Larpercore, and not all members condone or are linked to such groups.
Larpercore users primarily express their aesthetic through their online identity:
It's worth noting that some Larpercore groups do not fit the exact aesthetic described in this description:
The hierarchy of the ""United Kingnites of the Krown"" (UKK) exemplifies the militaristic structures often adopted within Larpercore Discord servers.
While Larpercore is not a monolithic community, with variations among its subsets and groups, some common threads exist. Many groups, especially C-Grade, foster offensive online personas and adopt militaristic hierarchies within their Discord servers, using titles like ""Warden,"" ""Emperor,"" or ""Soldier."" These groups are often highly selective when it comes to new members, frequently demanding their opinions on certain topics and screenshots of their online connections, such as servers they're part of and friend lists. In extreme cases, ""Com"" groups may even force potential recruits to commit acts of violence as a condition of membership.
C-Grade groups often claim to oppose ""degeneracy,"" a term they vaguely use to describe fandoms and subcultures they dislike. This sentiment typically manifests in cyberbullying campaigns against other online communities. However, there is a degree of hypocrisy within these groups because some members engage in cybercrime and view shock content. While the majority of C-Grade consider illegal content to be degenerate, a minority either justify it or see no issue with it, particularly when they claim to use it for ""toxxing"" (falsely mass-reporting a Discord server). To avoid bans and reports, these groups heavily moderate their servers, often by constantly deleting messages, a practice they call ""purging.""
Larpercore groups, influenced by Discord and 4chan, primarily consist of Generation Z teenagers. While it is predominantly composed of males aged 13 to 20, some older individuals, particularly in ""com"" groups, engage in predatory behavior. The presence of women in Larpercore groups is almost minimal, with some aligning with the ""Femcel"" archetype and anime shows such as Serial Experiments Lain. Members display hostility towards the LGBTQ+ community, frequently engaging in targeted harassment against transgender and non-straight individuals. Many participants have inflated perceptions of their online ""power"" and derive satisfaction from cyberbullying. Though less common, some Generation Alpha teenagers may be attracted to the aesthetic through online propaganda, particularly in games like Roblox.[22]
Disturbingly, members often mock real-life deaths and tragedies, referencing figures like George Floyd, Ronnie McNutt, Shuaib Aslam, Rorochan_1999, and Technoblade in insensitive ways. These ""memes"" manifest in various forms, including fake gaming YouTube channels that pretend to be run by the deceased, often with names like ""[Deceased Person] Gaming."" They also use trivializing catchphrases that reduce the tragedy of their deaths to simple jokes or slogans. Deepfakes featuring the deceased in disrespectful or exploitative scenarios are another common form. Incelcore songs with edgy lyrics that use the deaths as shock value or lyrical content, and shock content compilations that include graphic footage of the deaths alongside other disturbing content are also prevalent. Furthermore, there are controversial Friday Night Funkin' mods that incorporate insensitive depictions of the deaths, with Naxinet's ""Monday Morning Live Leakin'"" mod being particularly notorious for mocking various deaths and even sampling 911 calls.
This disturbing behavior extends beyond mocking victims and also includes the glorification of terrorists and mass shooters. Figures like the Columbine shooters, Brenton Tarrant, and Théodore Kaczynski are idolized, either for shock value or out of genuine admiration. This is prevalent in online spaces like Roblox, where users create avatars and games referencing these tragedies,[23] demonstrating a disturbing lack of empathy. For example, some Roblox users create games and avatars that recreate the deaths of those they mock in disturbing detail. A particularly egregious example is the ""Roro Simulator"" which recreates Rorochan_1999's suicide. Even events like the Christchurch mosque shootings have been recreated within Roblox.
The glorification of murderers, coupled with the mockery of the deceased, is a disturbing trend within the Larpercore community that goes beyond simple ""edgy humor."" This obsession with death and tragedy reveals a disturbing desensitization and lack of empathy within certain segments of the community. Groups such as the Foodists exploit these tragedies for shock value and attention, demonstrating a profound disrespect for human life and suffering. While there's no single explanation for this behavior, some believe it's an attempt to recreate the controversial nature of 4chan during the mid-2000s, where suicide victims were openly mocked with little to no repercusions.
Members of Larpercore groups utilize a distinct lexicon derived from various online communities, including Discord, 4chan, and Telegram. This jargon often reflects the subculture's focus on trolling, raiding, and other disruptive online activities. This specialized vocabulary not only facilitates communication within Larpercore groups but also reinforces their shared identity and online culture. Additionally, some groups might have their own catchphrases and inside jokes (e.g., ""Fear the hog"" in The Sewer Pig or ""Fries R Up"" in UTTP) but they are not included due to their group-specific usage. Examples of this jargon can be found in the list below.
Larpercore adherents engage in a range of activities, from creating edgy ""propaganda"" videos with militaristic aesthetics on YouTube Shorts to creating ""ragebait"" content on Discord and YouTube. Cyberbullying and witch-hunting individuals over their interests is common. They engage in cringe culture by mocking various groups and creating ""cringe compilations."" Vandalizing wiki websites is quite popular, especially when it documents a piece of media they dislike.
They participate in ""nuking"" Discord servers and obsess over hacker culture. Pretending to be part of the military and adopting a militaristic persona is common. Some members tend to read Encyclopedia Dramatica, a satirical wiki site that focuses on offensive humor, although they tend to not actually engage with the website's community. ""Skidding"" refers to stealing scripts and code, usually from Github. Mass-disliking YouTube videos (a practice known as ""dislike bombing"") was prevalent until YouTube removed the public visibility of dislikes; nowadays groups such as Anime Sucks' UTTP prefer spamming comment sections with links to their Discord servers and illegal content. Trolling and vandalizing wikis are also common activities. They often watch and share real-life gore and other types of shock content to unsuspecting people. Glorifying terrorists and mass shooters while also mocking real-life tragedies is also prevalent.
Larpercore doesn't have a single associated music genre, but generally favors music with aggressive or provocative themes and lyrics. Groups like UTTP lean towards Eurobeat and a YTPMV editing style, while ""com"" groups such as 764 and their many offshoots are known for their presence on SoundCloud. There, they create and curate playlists of intense, edgy electronic music, allegedly to ""brainwash"" their victims.[32] Larpercore members often recognize songs solely from their appearance in shock content and gore videos. The most infamous example is Lipps Inc.'s ""Funkytown,"" a disco classic that they associate with a brutal cartel video.
On Roblox, Larpercore users frequently listen to ""bypassed audios"" (audios that circumvent Roblox's content filters) and meme rap songs with loud and disrespectful lyrics. Incelcore, with its extremely provocative lyrics referencing Gen Z internet culture, is often used on 4chan and Discord. Additionally, patriotic music, military marches, and songs from the Yugoslav Wars appear to be popular among Larpercore community members, potentially influenced by ""Serbwave.""
There is a loose connection between Larpercore and underground SoundCloud genres like Necrotrap/Horrorcore. A musical artist known as RejectedReyna made a song titled ""SICKFUQ-NATION,"" referencing an extremely disturbing gore edit video created by 764 that involved animal cruelty.

Liminal Space,https://aesthetics.fandom.com/wiki/Liminal_Space,"Liminal Space aesthetics revolve around pictures of transitional areas devoid of life, such as malls in the early morning, empty parking lots or a school hallway during summer. Liminal imagery is often defined by the absence of people, a frozen and slightly unsettling appearance and an indefinite sense of familiarity, which is achieved through the usage of elements such as late 20th and early 21th century architecture and furniture, linoleum tilings, ceiling tiles and cool-toned fluorescent lighting. Despite its initial focus on the photography of vacant spaces, the aesthetic evolved to adapt to a multitude of settings and media formats.
On May 12, 2019, an anonymous 4chan user on the site's /x/ paranormal board called for posts of ""disquieting images that just feel 'off'"". The images posted gave rise to what is today popularly known as liminal space; however, while 4chan might've catapulted liminal spaces into the mainstream, the film The Shining (1980), and its depiction of an empty and sprawling hotel, has been identified as one of the main inspirations for a lot of modern-day media pertaining to liminal spaces.
Despite this, however, possibly the best-known and earliest example of the liminal space as an Internet sub-culture is The Backrooms; an internet urban legend that is described as ""what you see when you no-clip out of reality"". The Backrooms has been adapted into a variety of media, but has been a particularly popular topic in the realm of video games, where no less than 5 games are based on the concept. In videos on YouTube discussing liminal spaces, The Backrooms are a popular point of reference to use when describing the aesthetic as a whole.
True to its etymology (""liminal"" being derived from the Latin word limen, meaning ""threshold""), the idea of a liminal space encompasses locations that, due to their function, are transitional in nature - hallways, waiting rooms, parking lots and rest stops are archetypical examples. Liminal space aesthetics arise from the feelings of eeriness, nostalgia, and apprehension people describe when presented with such places outside of their designed context; most notably, their function as intermediary points between origin and destination. For instance, empty stairwells or hospital corridors at night are often considered foreboding and creepy because these places are usually brimming with life, and the absence of people creates an otherworldly and forlorn atmosphere.
While this definition is the closest to the academic meaning of liminality, the aesthetic changed over time to include imagery of spaces devoid of human presence that are simply nostalgic, dreamlike or uncanny, even when such places aren't considered liminal per se (e.g. Poolcore). This expanded scope also gave the phenomenon a wider appeal among those from the X, Millennial and Z generations, who connected the mysterious allure of liminal spaces with their own infancy and cultural memory, usually through the frequent use of locations such as roadside attractions, playgrounds, vacant houses or abandoned malls, but also visual aspects such as poor lighting, compression effects, camera noise and old-fashioned décor. Due to their nostalgic appeal and dreamlike atmosphere, leading many to reflect on the passage of time and yearn for times of innocence and optimism associated with childhood and coming-of-age periods, liminal spaces are also strongly linked with Traumacore, Hauntology, Dreamcore, and other similar aesthetics.
Liminal space aesthetics also have a significant overlap with those of After Hours, since both explore the atmosphere of vacant spaces that are, by nature, easier to find during night time. But while the After Hours aesthetic plays with feelings of peacefulness and tranquillity, Liminal Space's appeal comes from their unsettling atmosphere. After Hours aesthetics are also generally more grounded in reality, opposed to the common dream-like vibe found in Liminal Spaces.
Liminal spaces are also quite subjective. What appears nostalgic to one person may be more unsettling to another, while some may find the same image bland with no emotions attached to it. There is even debate as to whether it should even be considered an aesthetic, given how much it can rely on cultural hallmarks that vary from place to place.
Liminal space aesthetics consists of any room, corridor, or hallway that is big and empty, yet carries an eerie and unsettling vibe with it; this part is key in separating the Liminal Space aesthetic from just a regular photo of an empty room, corridor or hallway. This disconcerting effect can also be achieved with simple lighting tricks, nonsensical architecture, misplaced elements, moody lightning or photo editing (Vaporwave, Acidwave, and Glitch edits, in particular, can assist in this effect, although applying too much of these can sometimes ruin the liminality of the image).
Some edits of liminal spaces can give the effect of being in a retro horror or RPG video game (as popularized by YouTuber/Instagrammer YOURLOCALBREADMAN) which can tap into either the uncomfortable, the surreal, or could just go full-on Lovecraftian with some of the design choices made in these style of video edits. Empty game servers and maps have also been described as liminal, especially those presenting older and more rudimentary graphics such as No Players Online and early Call of Duty instalments, but also Source engine games like GMod and Team Fortress.

Lovecore,https://aesthetics.fandom.com/wiki/Lovecore,"Lovecore, which shares the visuals and ethos of Valentine's Day, is based on the visual culture of romantic love and infatuation. The forms of love that the aesthetic specifically focuses on are affectionate, dopamine-filled, and ""gushy."" It can involve both requited and unrequited relationships, with both crushing on someone from afar and the rituals of dating being shown in these images. Relationships could be both new and juvenile or old and familiar. The more mature seductive and erotic aspects of love are not featured, as visually, these often do not match the visuals and younger audience of Lovecore, although it can be paired with it’s sister aesthetic Lustcore for those wanting to incorporate the more adult aspects. The potentially sad and heartbreak aspect of love/unrequited love is also not included.
People who enjoy the aesthetic are not necessarily actively crushing on anyone or in a relationship depicted in the aesthetic. The aesthetic largely speaks about crushes and relationships in the theoretical, with there not being a true person that the original poster is thinking about. People who enjoy romance fiction, queer people who celebrate love, and people who wish for romantic experiences are some examples of people who appreciate the aesthetic. It is also a common aesthetic for people to take on during Valentines Day.
Visually, Lovecore tends to focus on the commercialization of love through Valentine's Day decorative trends. The rituals associated with romance are also heavily featured, especially in text. The aesthetic has substyles that can emphasize vintage, anime, or Cottagecore visuals.
Lovecore originated on Tumblr but later spread to many other platforms such as TikTok and Pinterest.
Popular motifs include hearts, boxes of chocolate, lipstick, love letters, cupid, angels, and the colours red and pink. There are also at times vintage elements present in the form of scans of Valentine's Day cards from the 1950s and 60s. There is sometimes overlap with Animecore in the form of pink manga edits and images of anime characters with hearts in their eyes. There may be Rococo artwork/inspired visuals as well. Most visuals tend to be very girly.
Lovecore fashion is a mix of not too overly erotic lingerie, angel wings, satin dresses, and just general formal date wear, though sometimes people who identify with the aesthetic adopt a Softie look or opt for graphic t-shirts with the aforementioned themes. Larme-styled and Coquette outfits are also popular. Colors like pink, red, and white, as well as motifs such as hearts and lipstick marks, are also fairly common. Some garments include:
Painting of Goddess Aphrodite and her lover Adonis
Pagano-Lovecore focuses on the iconography of love in Greco-Roman mythology and the Italian Renaissance, rather than the modern popular culture and commercialized love aesthetic. Fixated on Greco-Roman gods and goddesses, beautiful statues, doves, old jewelry, ancient love poetry, philosophical ideas of love, and other antique things in Rome or ancient Greece. Figures include Aphrodite/Venus, Eros/Cupid(before he became represented as a baby), Adonis, and other love deities. There can be overlap with aesthetics like Romantic Academia and Goddesscore. There is also an association with neo-paganism/witchcraft and may overlap with Bubblegum Witch. More deities and visuals can be found at Hellenic.","1960s, 2010s",,"Hearts, love letters, kisses, bouquets, cherubs","Red, pink, white, hot pink",
Major League Gaming,https://aesthetics.fandom.com/wiki/Major_League_Gaming,"Major League Gaming (abbreviated as MLG) is a meme aesthetic that was popular roughly from 2013 to 2017. The term originated from the Esports organization of the same name and it used to be a way to refer to professional video game players, although later it was used to represent someone being very awesome, specifically in a video game.
In the 2010s, it was shortened to MLG and began to be associated with a genre of internet memes that were based around video games. It usually is an video-based aesthetic, and the videos feature compilations of various Esports memes and flashing rainbows.
During the early 2020s, MLG saw some resurgence because some Gen Z teenagers found comfort on it due to the nostalgia or the colorfulness of its aesthetic. In meme generationology, MLG is included as part of the ""Dank Meme Era"", and its sucessor is considered to be Surreal Memes and Deep Fried Memes, which together make up the ""Surreal Era"".
MLG memes started out as a parody of professional gaming montages, incorporating clips of Call of Duty, Esports teams such as FaZe Clan, and Dubstep music. Doritos and Mountain Dew were also associated with MLG due to often collaborating with Call of Duty. As MLG evolved, it incorporated more random references to popular media and memes at the time, such as Doge and the Illuminati.

Messy French It Girl,https://aesthetics.fandom.com/wiki/Messy_French_It_Girl,"An offshoot of the French It Girl aesthetic, the Messy French It Girl aesthetic is a more modern, laid back take on the effortless charisma of the French It Girl. It is closely related to Chic Modernist.
Dion the Taurus[1] in her video ""Style Analysis: The Messy French Girl - opulence, cigarettes + continued Francophila"" describes the aesthetic as follow:
""The messy French It Girl has an effortless elegance that you love about the classic French It Girl, without the stripes and berets. The Messy French It Girl will go out and share a cigarette with the Rockstar Girlfriend, but will skip the 4 AM bedtime and hangover and instead meet you at 10:30 for an eight dollar café au lait. The Messy French It Girl's best friend is a Model Off Duty, but that extreme dieting, all black wearing life is too rigid and somber for her ever-curious and spontaneous life. The Messy French It Girl loves how [the] Coquette embraces femininity but [would] rather stick with ivory creams and beiges than baby pinks. The Messy French It Girl wakes up early but arrives late, has a cigarette with her Dom Perignon on her balcony, and loves matching her boyfriend's white button down with her Chanel pumps. She's a beautiful mess, always put together but never perfect. She's a ruthless heartbreaker and a hopeless romantic. [She is] effortless, tasteful, sparkly, but always understated; [she is] a quiet elegance married with a sprinkle of chaos and edge.""
Just as the French It Girl aesthetic embodied western francophilia in the 60’s & 70’s, the Messy French It Girl embodies francophilia in modern times. Though the French It Girl aesthetic made a comeback around 2014 and inspired the Pink Parisian aesthetic, and is still considered a popular style of dress today, younger generations do not always connect with it very well. The popularization of darker aesthetics, along with effortlessly chic, ‘messy’ aesthetics (such as model off duty, etc.) made the so-called “perfect storm” for the Messy French It Girl to arise.
The resurgence of The French It Girl trend illustrates the way fashion trends have a tendency to cycle back and appeal to newer generations, this of course, results in potential high profits for brands. The style intersects in many ways with both the Rockstar Girlfriend and Coquette aesthetics, as it has a grungier version of the traditional, lighter French It Girl look. This edgier version can be seen as the nighttime version of the classic daytime French It Girl style.[2]
People that are considered style inspo for the Messy French It Girl aesthetic include:
As with most aesthetics born through TikTok, the aesthetic most often excludes people who are not young, upper-class, thin, white women. It also idealizes the ""Heroin Chic"" body that rose in popularity in the 90's and 2000's.[2]",,,,"Red, black, cremes and nudes",
Mizuiro,https://aesthetics.fandom.com/wiki/Mizuiro,"Mizuiro (水色, meaning ""water colored"" or ""aqua"") is a Japanese Kawaii aesthetic that utilizes a light blue color palette and visuals from contemporary youth in the nation. Its mood is largely pessimistic, with cold tones, slouchy clothing, and an association with Otaku culture. The style is heavily associated with Cybercore, and draws inspiration from blue and white Kawaii Gamer setups (which are often inspired by the Sanrio character Cinamaroll). Mizuiro fashion(specifically Jersey Maid) can sometimes be seen in Jirai Kei.
Western fans had mistakenly referred to the 2020s revival of Mizuiro as Tenshi Kaiwai (天使界隈, Angel Neighborhood ); this is actually the community hashtag of the Tenshi Zyoshi magazine/blog that featured the aesthetic, not the aesthetic itself. It is also sometimes misspelled as Tenshi Kawaii, which the Japanese community does not use.
The community for this aesthetic creates content on Instagram and TikTok, which you can find by searching 水色界隈 (mizuiro community), 水色サブカル (mizuiro subculture), and 水色雰囲気 (mizuiro aesthetic).
Before it was given any name, the aesthetic was mostly associated with Ano from the now distinct Japanese idol group You'll Melt More! as well as her fans during the mid-to-late 2010s. As the ""light blue"" member of the group, she was mainly known for being a social outcast and her customized tracksuits, both of which are still a recurring theme in the aesthetic to this today.
In 2020, due to a tracksuit boom, a renewed interest in the aesthetic occurred, causing a new peak in its popularity.
Mizuiro color range
Most images in this aesthetic have been edited to be cooler toned, with a bluish-gray hue over the image. The colors in this aesthetic always include light blue (hence the name) and white. Black and silver are other common colors. Pink may show through because of the popular trend of excess blush makeup and its ubiquity in Kawaii merchandise. Some mizuiro visuals incorporate cyber/webcore visuals from the 90s or 2000s to early 2010s, with low-poly computer generated imagery, old web design and fonts, and Web 1.0 internet UIs.
Cute, minimalistic illustrations are also a popular motif in this aesthetic and very reminiscent of wabi-sabi with their wobbly outlines and unpolished look. They usually feature original characters created for purely aesthetic reasons rather than a story.
However, characters from specific anime and franchises may be featured too. People in this aesthetic may own figurines, posters, and various other merchandise centered around these characters, similar to Kawaii Gamer. A common character is Rei Ayanami from Neon Genesis Evangelion, hangyodon from Sanrio, as well as Hachiware from Chiikawa, and the de facto mascot is Sanrio's Cinnamoroll. What all these characters have in common is that white and blue are their main colors, which explains their popularity in the mizuiro community.
The locations many images take place in also reflect an Otaku lifestyle. Many photos often take place in arcades and gamer set-ups. The photos also often have an industrial edge to them, as many photos were taken in city streets and parking garages, with concrete and steel being common in the background.
Popular with Gen Z! Mizuiro Kaiwai
While the aesthetic covers a wide range of styles, there is a few elements that are characteristic of mizuiro fashion.
This fashion style mainly consists a light blue color scheme, usually with hints of sportiness or techwear influences like tracksuits, hoodies, etc. Sometimes flared leg warmers are included. Usually features kawaii imagery or a general soft feel, and is paired with old web aesthetics.
Written as ジャージメイド in Japanese, the jersey maid style is a fashion style that utilizes tracksuits (commonly called jerseys in Japan) with maid-like details, such as ruffles and lace. Outfits consisting of an oversized tracksuit worn in combination with a maid headdress and apron are the most common, but there's also many clothes specifically made with the style in mind that can often resemble Girly and Lolita fashion.
Content creators on TikTok often create videos of them wearing the light blue outfits and dancing to fast-paced electronic dance music or VOCALOID music. Commonly, these people cover up their face with stickers or use filters.
Like in other fashion-centered TikTok communities, there are also many videos where people following the aesthetic show off their latest hauls, introduce their favorite brands, or recommend specific products and where to get them.",2010s,,Cool toned filters,"Light blue, turquoise, white, sometimes grey",
Moe Swag,https://aesthetics.fandom.com/wiki/Moe_Swag,"Moe Swag, also known as Gangstas with Waifus,[1] is a meme aesthetic that juxtaposes imagery related to gangster culture with moe anime girls. It consists of edits, graffiti, and artwork featuring real-life people alongside anime characters. This aesthetic also manifests in meme rap and hip-hop songs inspired by anime or Future Funk. It gained significant relevance in the 2010s and experienced a resurgence in 2022 when a meme featuring the song ""Just the Two of Us"" went viral.
The real-life figures depicted in these memes are often gangsters, people associated with gang culture, famous rappers, and controversial politicians (sometimes including terrorists). In contrast, the anime characters are typically cute and popular figures, often girls, including neko (cat-like) characters.
The appeal of this meme stems from its combination of reality and fiction, blending two disparate worlds. Gangster culture and otaku culture have little in common, creating an unexpected and often humorous contrast.
The defining features featured in this memes are pretty simple, including:
The music associated with Moe Swag typically involves Future Funk remixes of existing rap and hip-hop songs. Additionally, satirical meme rap songs about intense love for anime characters are also common. These songs often feature satirical lyrics that express romantic feelings towards fictional characters, sometimes bordering on sexually suggestive themes. Various artists, including Moe Shop, Hentai Dude, Shiki-TMNS, Pink Guy, and MC Virgins, have created songs or remixes that incorporate anime samples and culture into rap music or viceversa.
While less prevalent than in rap, this aesthetic can also be found in songs from other genres like Breakcore, Lolicore, Trillwave, J-core, and Hardcore Techno. For example, the Swedish J-core musician Helblinde has created a song titled ""Putin's Boner,"" which combines the Russian national anthem with cute samples from anime, ""Katyusha"" from the anime Girls Und Panzer, and ""Get Low"" by Lil Jon & The East Side Boyz. The Moe Swag aesthetic is also associated with Nerdcore.

Morute,https://aesthetics.fandom.com/wiki/Morute,"Morute, a name combining the words ""morbid"" and ""cute,"" is an aesthetic created in the early 2010s that expresses the dichotomy between the hyper-femininity and softness of a childhood/girlhood in the past with the darker imagery of true crime and American Gothic elements. In the community, users often use it as an outlet for expressing trauma, especially those surrounding eating disorders and child abuse. The community largely developed from the music of Nicole Dollanganger and influential photographers such as Jess Woods and milliedollgraves, who have since deactivated. It is more commonly known as ""Sadbbydoll"", due to those in the aesthetic looking like sad baby dolls.
Many visuals suggest physical abuse, sexual assault/molestation, emotional abuse, self-destruction, religious trauma, and physical disability. The child-like imagery serves as a desire to return to a girlhood that was ripped away from them, with the Christian, angelic, and cute motifs being an idealization of purity and innocence. Religious guilt is a common motif, with the desire to go to Heaven, but feeling unable due to the victim being ""dirtied"" with whatever traumatized them. This can create some overlap with Sacricore. The idea of ‘dirtiness’ and rot is a common theme. Poverty within small-town Americana is also present, and it reflects the influence of horror movies and the idea of home being sullied and unsafe.
It is a precursor to Traumacore, and that aesthetic is an example of convergent evolution, wherein two aesthetics express the same thing, but the later community is relatively unaware of its predecessor and its influences. The aesthetic is one that has largely fallen out of popularity due to the current notoriety of Traumacore, the insular community, mental recovery of many influencers, and discourse surrounding the aestheticization of dark themes. The community itself does not emphasize the necessity of actually having trauma. Many simply are visually attracted to the contrast between cutesy, girly, childish aesthetics with dark, creepy, Gothic aesthetics, and there is no need to discuss or vent about past experiences.
Morute as a community in Tumblr during 2014 involved a number of bloggers who would photograph the visuals associated with the subject. They often had an individual modus operandi and style that, while unique to them, focused on the same contrast between cute and morbid. In addition to the photographs was music, with Nicole Dollanganger being the most influential, both in music and in visuals. See the section below for specific influencers.
Part of the popularity and the reason why the aesthetic looks the way it does is from influences from other aesthetics concurrent to the beginning of Morute. For example, Tumblr has a large Grunge community, which explains the link towards grunge music and the fashion style of Kinderwhore, which is characterized by vintage nightgowns and tattered motifs. Delicate Sweet, which was an aesthetic popular at the same time as Morute, can be interpreted as a non-dark version of the aesthetic, with both communities reblogging from each other, along with the Babycore aesthetic, which developed after both Morute and Delicate Sweet. Dollcore, especially the darker side of it, also has a lot of influence on Morute, which leads to elements of J-fashions like Gothic Lolita and, in particular, Cult Party Kei(a fashion characterized by its use of pastel, diaphanous vintage garments such as bed jackets, night gowns, and layered skirts, as well as its use of rosaries and red medical crosses) in some Morute looks.
The darker components of the aesthetic could come from Balkan Violence Tumblr, where male users posted photos of guns, soldiers, BDSM/Bondage, and blood. Another darker community that often overlaps in motif was Nymphet, which also romanticizes dangerous men, as well as Babygirl which centers on the DDLG kink dynamic. However, different community members disagreed on this and often came into conflict with themselves and others in the context of Morute being an aesthetic to engage and heal from trauma, rather than re-traumatizing themselves. A later influence was that of the Regional Gothic aesthetics, which led to Tumblr users posting an influx of abandoned churches, highways, suburbs, etc. The Bubble Goth aesthetic was also an influence on Morute, with similar clothing styles and visuals, including stuff like gas masks which are seen in Morute and the Cyber Goth inspired side of Bubble Goth.
As the community grew, there was interaction between different members, such as in Tumblr asks, comments in reblogs, etc, sometimes leading to photoshoots done together. And with concerts from Nicole Dollanganger and grunge bands being possible, there was an in-person component since their concerts would be attended by those in the community.
However, the community also had negative interactions because those both within and outside of the community disagreed with a number of controversial actions, as seen in the Criticism section.
In the late 2010s, the community began to wane in popularity because of the conflict, as well as some photographers (i.e. Jess Woods) deactivating. This was likely because of hateful comments, but the exact reason is unknown.
The community especially took a hit during the Tumblr purge[1], done in December 2018, which caused multiple Tumblr users to lose their accounts. Morute fans often reblogged images that would be against the new ban on adult content, such as images that referenced bondage and the Nymphet community. Many blogs were also removed because they contained pro-Ana and self-harm content. Because of this purge, many accounts are now lost. Some dedicated users have rebuilt their old blogs, which explains why multiple users do not have content before 2018, despite their previous content on the site. Images from deleted accounts are still lost, such as those from the blogs deleted in 2014.
Another factor of the decline is that a community member was murdered by an ex-boyfriend in 2019 after a Nicole Dollanganger concert[2]. This made the aspects of Morute romanticizing serial killers, age gaps, kidnapping, etc. more controversial, as there was a person directly affected by this. A different reason why some members moved on from Morute is that the claim of the aesthetic being a tool for moving on from trauma may either be successful or a failure. With the users recovering, they would see less of a need to participate in the community, or they may realize that the aesthetic is harming their personal recovery and leave.
Meanwhile, in the late 2010s (approximately 2018), Traumacore became an aesthetic. Like Morute, this aesthetic draws from the juxtaposition between cute visuals and decay and claims to be a tool to move past trauma. However, these aesthetics differ in many of their influences and visuals. Traumacore involves text edits, cartoon and anime visuals, and lacks a fashion component, while Morute is more Gothic and involves more motifs. Traumacore's popularity led to this aesthetic replacing Morute as Tumblr's primary creepy-cute aesthetic.
Because of the greater interest in Tumblr aesthetics during the pandemic[3], users on TikTok who did not experience the aesthetic firsthand began to find the aesthetic, partially because of the existence of this page. However, there were multiple changes as a new group of users reinterpreted the aesthetic. For example, there is less emphasis on Nicole Dollanganger's music and more emphasis on faster paced electronic music which is more popular on the platform in general. The makeup and fashion is also more over-the-top and exaggerated, often taking inspiration from Lolita fashion, Dollcore, Kawaii/Babygirl, etc. Some users also decided to lean further into the Gothic side of things, dressing in darker colors than in original Morute, possibly more similar to Welwitschia Goth.
Later, around 2022, the aesthetic Gloomy Coquette came to be, as inspired by Coquette and Delicate Sweet aesthetics. Many of the visuals in this TikTok/Pinterest aesthetic take the photography of Jess Woods, Nicole Dollanganger, etc., but add a white filter over the images.
Watercolor on a doily by Nicole Dollanganger
Nicole Dollanganger is a Canadian singer-songwriter whose music and visual presence on Tumblr greatly influenced, and arguably created, the Morute aesthetic. Her stage name, Dollanganger, was taken from the Gothic novel Flowers in the Attic, which explores poverty, abuse, incest, and religious fear, which are multiple motifs that appear in her songs and later Morute artworks[4]. In 2011, she released her first song, ""Coma Baby,"" on Tumblr to great praise. Her music is characterized by her ethereal, child-like voice contrasting with lyrics about kink, violence, and depression, something that is both influenced and admired by metal and hardcore musicians.[5]
Her now deleted aesthetic, personal, and self-promotional blog on Tumblr contained multiple visuals associated with Morute: bondage, horror movie stills, 1920s porcelain dolls (which she collects), and her own hand-drawn illustrations which decorate her vintage bedroom. This led to the growth of her fanbase, which contained other aesthetic enthusiasts, such as Cult Party Kei fans and Gothic Lolitas who would regularly communicate with her and foster a community.[6]
Allison Harvard’s iconic “Creepy Chan”
Allison Harvard Burke is an American model and known internet celebrity. She started officially modeling in 2009, however debuted her career in America’s Next Top Model in 2005, and was a runner-up in that same contest in season 12 and 17. Before she debuted, she became an internet meme recognized as “Creepy Chan” on 4chan when a photo of her wearing a pink dress in a dim room spread around. [7]
Many Morute bloggers are inspired by her “Creepy Chan” look, even if she isn’t Morute-esque herself.
Jess Woods is a deactivated Tumblr user who would post hundreds of her own photographs. Her style ranges from hazy and whitewashed to found footage-esque. Her photo subjects include gloomy scenes of her small suburban town, herself wearing girly J-fashion and vintage nightwear, and small trinkets often found in the Morute aesthetic. Many images typically circulated in the Morute community are hers, and she has also influenced other aesthetic communities such as Suburban Gothic, Delicate Sweet, Pink Parisian, Babycore, and Kawaii. She deactivated in 2014, but a fan blog has archived most of her photography here.

The visuals of Morute rely on the juxtaposition between sweetness and death. The most popular and recognizable images are typically macabre subjects framed with a cute background, such as a knife on a pink bedsheet. The lighting is typically either shadowed and reminiscent of vintage photographs and advertisements or over-exposed, creating a white haze over the photo. The most popular colors in the aesthetic are pink and white, but gray and black contrast the cute images. The tumblr blogs in this aesthetic also commonly reblog photos with two different aesthetics in succession. For example, a blog may have one post be a purely Delicate Sweet collection of dresses and then have the next photo be of a gun collection from a violence-themed blog. Bloggers often post pictures of themselves wearing doll-like and feminine clothing and holding a rifle, or wearing a gas mask.
The most feminine visuals take inspiration from vintage 1950s boudoir/bedrooms. Many Morute bloggers owned lingerie, old perfume bottles, jewelry, and various vintage knickknacks from that period. These items were typically found in thrift stores or passed down, and share visual similarities with Shabby Chic. This also creates overlap with the Trailer Park Princess aesthetic.
Christianity in general is heavily referenced throughout this entire aesthetic. Angels and cherubs appear in artwork, with the semi-naturalistic art being put on stickers, trinket boxes, and wall art. Feathered white wings frequently appear as decoration or worn as a fashion accessory. Crosses and crucifixes are another reference to Christ as well as other religious talismans, such as candles, statuettes, and relics. These are often spread on a bed, collected on a wall, or made into a shrine with an alarming amount of religious paraphernalia, showing the obsessive dedication and fascination with religion. Vintage photographs of religious ceremonies, such as weddings and baptisms, which feature women or little girls dressed in pale, feminine clothing, are also popular and reference the feminine beauty and purity of some Christian traditions. Nicole Dollanganger often references religion in her music, with songs like ""700 Club"" and ""Tammy Faye"". This religious imagery is often dark and ‘impure’, with as Catholic Horror imagery being popular. This relates to the common theme in the aesthetic of the corruption of innocence.
The aesthetic also heavily plays off of the idea of ""home,"" which would not exist for a victim of domestic abuse and sexual trauma. Many images are of abandoned and decaying houses that have either clear signs of destruction or outdated feminine features. These often overlap with Southern Gothic and Grandparentcore. Torn floral wallpaper, piles of broken wood, graffiti from trespassers, and patches of broken plaster are almost always in these photos. However, non-destroyed pastel suburban houses from the 1950s-1970s in hazy photography are common too.
Graveyards are another common photo subject that includes images of these places, girls in Morute clothing being in the space, and specific gravestones carrying a touching message (typically for a child or baby). There is often a connection to Ghostcore, or the idea of the girl being a ghost or being dead, which goes with the theme of being broken and ‘killed’ by childhood trauma.
Another location that is connected to the vintage, youthful, and feminine aesthetic is carnivals, with rides and stands such as carousels, horror-themed funhouses, and sweets stands. These can be fully operational or abandoned. Vintage style, usually pastel, clowns may be a part of this due to killer clowns and clowns often being seen as creepy in general.
Antique baby and children's paraphernalia is another common subject, specifically around practices that were normal/considered sentimental and cute in the past, but are now seen as creepy. In the past, parents would collect cut locks of hair, baby teeth, and gift their children porcelain or bisque dolls and stuffed animals. Many photos show the OP's collection of such objects in a box or arranged in a shrine-like fashion. There is a lot of overlap with Babycore.
Another Victorian-inspired visual of the aesthetic are medical tools and asylums/hospitals from that era, especially lobotomies. These instruments are often collected, and often gorey images of medical procedures, organs, and bloodied objects are included on blogs. Similarly, severe mutations, especially conjoined twins, are commonly seen in both daguerreotypes and animals.
Building off on this, vulnerable/prey animals such as rabbits, lambs, deer, and sometimes kittens are frequently featured, often decorated in ribbon similar to vintage card illustrations. Bugs related to decay, such as maggots, cockroaches, and worms are also included because of their relationship with death and abandonment.
Blood, bruises, and cuts are present, always on a pale young woman's body. These have multiple reasons; self-harm scars and cuts, menstruation, BDSM injuries, abuse, and bumps and scrapes are explained in the caption of the post.
Imagery related to BDSM is common, but not always. Rope bondage, choking, duct-taped women, knifeplay, gags, pretend kidnapping, etc. can appear. The woman is dressed cutely in a DDlg manner, and contrasts the male dominant, who is typically in black, sometimes with a full-faced mask (balaclava, gas mask, etc.) Some of the appeal is that being bound by an ominous male dominant resembles kidnapping or being murdered, which matches the aesthetic's relationship with true crime and morbidity. Another big appeal is that CNC (consensual non-consent) is a kink that is often used as a way to help overcome past experiences of sexual assault, which is a big theme within Morute.
The look takes a lot of inspiration from Kinderwhore, as well as Coquette.
Under construction
As said in the Influences page, Nicole Dollanganger was the largest influence, with her music being shared within the community. As such, the music of Morute is largely defined by her. The non-Dollanganger artists included here are ones that appear in 8tracks playlists (see 2014 Tumblr for an explanation) and have a similar sound, but may not necessarily be as popular within the community.
In addition, grunge and metal bands were commonly referenced in the 2010s community. For example, merchandise and posters of influential bands such as Korn, Nirvana, Marilyn Manson, and Insane Clown Posse were common, especially when juxtaposed with soft or feminine decor and attire, such as a Nirvana poster on a pink bedroom wall.
As previously discussed, part of the origin of Morute was in female-led grunge bands that wore the Kinderwhore aesthetic. They were also included in aesthetic posts and playlists. Hole, Jack Off Jill, and Daisy Chainsaw among others were common. Hole's album Live Through This was also popular, as it contained many dark themes juxtaposed with metaphors of dolls, little girls, and innocence.
Some artists may also share some commonalities, such as the dichotomy between creepy and cute, but were not shared among the tumblr community during the time. They may sonically sound different, such as Jazmin Bean's use of electronic music or Melanie Martinez's more pop-oriented sound, the latter of which being more associated with the Soft Grunge circle rather than this one.
Some artists, namely Cozy St. Jean, Ethel Cain, Mercy Necromancy, Bambi Baker, and Elita, have produced music after the aesthetic's peak, but directly cited Dollanganger and the tumblr community as large influences on their music.
Morute experienced revival on TikTok that contributed to changes in what music was considered Morute. Dark electronic songs, such as After Dark by Mr. Kitty and Oblivion by Grimes, were often used in Morute TikToks, leading to people's idea of what music was Morute becoming more relaxed. Melanie Martinez also began to be much more associated with Morute.
There were also various other artists who produced music before, during, and after the peak on Tumblr that, rather than drawing inspiration from the Morute aesthetic, simply made music that juxtaposed the morbid and cute without being aware of the tag ""morute"". Other artists used the tag ""morute"" but are not as widely spread in the Morute community of today. These artists include:
The main criticism of Morute is how the depiction of the dark subject matter is romanticized and/or minimizes the actual pain and trauma that happens to the victims of abuse. This can also make the internet experience triggering for victims. Because Morute previously wasn't a tag, the images of abuse and self-harm would be seen in innocuous tags such as #pink or #cute, which can make a person healing unnecessarily see imagery that can make them relapse or hurt.
For example, many content-creators of Morute photographed their self-harm scars and bruises, often juxtaposed with pink ribbons and other girly accessories. While for some, this is an expression of their past pain and moving on from it, others may see it and think self-harm is a beautiful and normal expression of pain that should be emulated. Critics also are skeptical of the claim that posting the aesthetic is healing, as linking trauma with lifestyle and identity can make healing more difficult.
This aesthetic is also criticized by people for its depiction of violence. Some people in this aesthetic are adjacent to the true crime community, which on Tumblr, often centers around admiring and having crushes on serial killers and school shooters (also known as hybristophilia). Many songs in the Morute community reference this romantic fascination with killers, which has led to some incidents such as one in which many people began ""cancelling"" an artist who made songs of this nature.[8]
Additionally, domestic abuse is a frequent motif that is framed in a romantic sense. For example, captions under photos include ""He hit me, and it felt like a kiss."" ""He Hit Me (And it Felt Like a Kiss)"" is also a song by Nicole Dollanganger and a lyric used by Lana Del Rey, leading to the heavy usage of the phrase among Morute bloggers. Music and photos also include this romanticization, with photos of framed domestic violence, such as choking a woman being popular; however, this also ties into the BDSM connection, which is a culture that emphasizes consent.
The Morute community also has many users who make and reblog pro-Ana/thinspo content. Many bloggers both have Morute images on their blog and text posts documenting their anorexia in a positive light and blog posts depicting how little they eat. The images associated with Morute also allude to pro-Ana in that the women idealized in this aesthetic are often unhealthily thin, and some commonly reblogged photos serve a double function as ""body checks"" (small tests that confirm skinniness) such as thigh gaps and tiny wrists. This often led to conflict in the Morute community, as many enjoyers of the aesthetic use it to move on from their past eating disorders and perceive people encouraging disordered behaviors as bad representatives of the community.",Early 2010s,,"Death, cuteness, trauma, horror, girlhood, religion, depression

Mossy,https://aesthetics.fandom.com/wiki/Mossy,"Mossy is an aesthetic that focuses on forest and moss related things and objects. The main focus is dark, mossy forests and sometimes things like fungi and liverworts are prevalent. The main colour scheme is mostly various, usually dark, shades of green, browns and other natural hues, and light/bright colours almost never pop up. Man made objects in this aesthetic include, but are not limited to, shacks, huts and cabins. This aesthetic is closely related to other forest-themed aesthetics like Forestpunk, Cottagecore, and Mushroomcore.

The Tool Palette of SuperPaint, which was displayed on a second monitor
The history of digital art program goes all the way back to 1963 with the invented of Ivan Sutherland's Sketchpad, although it would take about another decade before digital art programs would begin to be able to create things resembling the topic of this page.
The 1972 Xerox Alto was a revolutionary computer that was designed with a graphical user interface (GUI) in mind. It came with a drawing program known as ""Draw"". A lot of the tools seen in it would be later used by other programs, including MS Paint, such as the simple brushes and fill tool. Although the computer was a commercial failure, it lead the way for those of the future, and ""Draw"" was later improved on by SuperPaint, PCPaint, MacPaint, and various other programs.

Microsoft Paint was released in 1985 as Microsoft's Windows 1.0's bundled in raster graphics editing software. The version of Paint on Windows 1 had many of the tools that still remain in today's versions of paint, such as the pencil, brush, line, text, fill, and the iconic airbrush, just to name a few. It did not support color, unlike some previous programs, but instead used patterns, similar to Flipnote, and even had a feature to create your own patterns, which is lacking in today's paint.
Later versions would reiterate on it. Examples would be such at Windows 3.1's paint adding color and 95 and 98's paints adding more brush options, XP removing the need for a palette, and so on.
Ms Paint on Windows XP
Windows 95 sold 40 million copies, more than every other version of Windows before combined, and as such introduced MS Paint to a lot of people. Combined with an ever growing internet, people would create and share things they've created. Because of the limited free tools at the time, a lot of people would use MS Paint as a quick and simple way to edit and create images. This would take form early in form of art, memes, comics, and, later on, videos.
Paint would not be commonly used in videos, especially animations, before YouTube, as Macromedia, later Adobe, Flash was used in place due to the .swf file's incredibly low file size compared to video formats as well as the program including its own art tools. Only after the creation and popularity of YouTube, MS Paint slide shows or animations, often created in tandem with Microsoft Movie Maker, started to pop up.
Paint's reputation would slowly go down over this period, as people grew away of better software and other free, better alternatives came to be and due to Microsoft's additions to it falling behind the competition, to the point where it was deprecated in Windows 10. There was still people who would use it for memes, nostalgia, or to show off that you can still create well made and impressive works in it.
As the name suggests, things with this aesthetic are usually made in MS Paint or in other software using limited tools. A lot of art will be of a lower quality, often because it was made by a child, someone with little experience, using a mouse, and/or is made non-seriously. The font of text will commonly be the default of the MS Paint version that was being used.
Common themes that show up in art are as follows:
Due to its easy accessibility on many computers, MS Paint was very popular to use in the early days of YouTube; anywhere from video comics to full animations.
Booby Tales

Oekaki (お絵描き) is Japanese for ""drawing"". On the internet, it is the term for a simplistic drawing tool used on message boards. It is similar to the MS Paint aesthetic due to the lack of advanced features.

Mushroomcore,https://aesthetics.fandom.com/wiki/Mushroomcore,"Mushroomcore is the aesthetic of mushrooms. Started in a Facebook group called 🍄Mushroomcore 🍄. Unlike its similar aesthetics Goblincore, Fairycore, and Cottagecore, this aesthetic is solely focused on mushrooms and nature. Different types of mushrooms are always used.
Mushrooms are universally known and widely used in different cultures, foods, and spiritual practices. ""The Fairy Circle"" is believed to be a portal to the spirit realm as told In many folklore tales. Mushrooms are often associated with the underworld, this is due to the fact that mushrooms decompose dead matter and are linked to the rebirth and recycling of dead matter. This means that there may be some overlap with the Ethereal Death aesthetic.
Mushrooms can also depict characteristics of good fortune and represent rapid growth. These are all themes that the Mushroomcore aesthetic seeks to portray and admire.
Mushroomcore fashion would include anything outside friendly and easy to partake mushroom hunting in. Clothing is usually a little dirty and includes earthy toned colors.

Naturecore,https://aesthetics.fandom.com/wiki/Naturecore,"Appreciation of nature
Naturecore is an aesthetic surrounding the theme of animals and other nature related things (ie. plants, forests, flowers, etc). It is similar to aesthetics like Earthcore and Cottagecore. Imagery of nature evokes a biophilic feel.
Naturecore visuals, unsurprisingly, focus a lot on nature and the idyllic and often romanticized version of being out in nature. That is, a serenity, solitude, and quiet broken only by the chirping of birds and the gentle rustling of leaves. Of course, that's not to stop Naturecore from going into some of the darker elements of nature (like the Cycle of Life, poisonous plants, and just the general struggle of the animal and plant kingdoms within nature), which can lead to some crossover with Vulture Culture. Sometimes, though, it invites out a call for adventure to seek out the unknown.
Images of nature, particularly forests, are very commonly used as phone and desktop wallpapers. Eberhard Grossgasteiger is a popular internet photographer who mainly photographs taiga scenes in the Italian alps. He is most-viewed uploader on the stock-photo sharing site Pexels [1] and he is on the Unsplash leaderboard too [2].
Visuals include:
Bloomcore is a subtype of Naturecore that focuses on flowers.
Dark Naturecore, also known as Dark Naturalism, is a darker take on Naturecore and often related to Dark Academia.
Mushroomcore is a specific type of Naturecore that focuses on mushrooms.

Necrotrap,https://aesthetics.fandom.com/wiki/Necrotrap,"Necrotrap is a niche subgenre of Trap Metal and an internet subculture that originated from the SoundCloud underground rap scene in the early 2020s.[1] It is characterized by its dark and disturbing lyrical content, frequently referencing themes like death, violence, suicide, drugs, graphic content, and Middle Eastern terrorism. This experimental genre was pioneered by the online music collective NECROSOCIETY, founded by Canadian rapper GOREJIT,[2] and has become prominent in SoundCloud.
The term is a combination of ""necro"" (from Greek nekros, meaning corpse or dead) and ""trap."" As implied, the music is characterized by a harsh and noisy sound. It often features heavily distorted or deep-fried ""corpse"" vocals, whispers, experimental beats, and unsettling lyrics. Lyrics commonly focus on graphic topics, including suicide attacks.
Necrotrap evolved from the pre-existing Trap Metal scene, a genre that combines elements of Trap music and Heavy Metal. Trap Metal gained mainstream recognition in the late-2010s, popularized by artists like Scarlxrd, Zillakami, Lil Darkie, and collectives such as Spider Gang and Trash Gang.
Canadian musician GOREJIT coined the term ""Necrotrap"" in 2020 to describe his distinct style within the genre.[3] This style incorporates themes of death, violence, and terrorism, along with heavily distorted vocals and aggressive production. Gorejit later became a prominent member of ""NECROSOCIETY,"" an online collective of Necrotrap artists who further developed the sound through their music and collaborations.
Necrotrap visuals are characterized by their focus on disturbing and offensive imagery. This is depicted in cover art, lyrics, and even artist names, which often aim to provoke or shock. Common themes in Necrotrap visuals include graphic depictions of violence, self-harm, suicide, weapons, drug use, and terrorism, especially imagery associated with Middle Eastern paramilitary groups. Artists will commonly have clay figures made by artist bezbique depicting their characters holding weapons or being mutilated in some way. Cover art frequently features violent acts such as shootings, beheadings, and bombings. The overall aesthetic can be described as extremely provocative and reliant on shock value, and references to shock sites are very common. It draws on elements of Emo culture (particularly Screamo music) while incorporating graphic and taboo subject matter.
Early Necrotrap vocals consisted mainly of whispering, with some artists such as GOREJIT and HXLX using low-pitched ""corpse"" vocals via vocal fry. Other artists like KILLRIDDLE and NEEDLEGUTS started out with yelling. As time went on, each artist gained their own distinct vocal style and distortion, such as NEEDLEGUTS's growling, tsaruicide's ""gay robot"" vocals, and SENTFROMIRAQ and FROSTTT's artificially high-pitched whispers.
Around 2024, artists started to further shift away from whispers, with JACKSAW and SCORN's fry screaming, KILLRIDDLE's scratchy, almost wheezing screams, HAUNTGAT's false chord barking, 8SEEKER's raspy yet somewhat baby-like voice, and even some singing being incorporated into songs.
Early Necrotrap used mainly 808s and snares in the beats. The beats would be louder than the vocals, made even more apparent through the process of sidechaining, which dampens the vocals whenever a certain sound is played. Later on, samples taken from Call of Duty and Action/Horror movies/documentaries would be used for intros, outros, or as general ambience for the beat. Memphis samples have always been used in Necrotrap production, especially by the producer FROSTTT. Necrotrap using Memphis samples is usually called ""Necrophonk."" Most beats are produced to convey a theme of Middle Eastern warfare, cyber terrorism, or horror.
Necrophonk is a community-coined term used to describe Necrotrap songs that utilize Memphis samples and/or cowbells in their beats. Most songs of this subgenre are produced by FROSTTT, however recently a surge in amount of Necrophonk YouTube beats has occurred, making more songs utilize these samples.
The term ""Torturecore"" was coined by the now disbanded ""trtureprn"" collective artists 717na and spxxky in 2022. It is used to describe a similar genre, as well as a show of the same name held in Chicago on April 22nd, 2023.[4][5] The primary difference is that it uses harsh screaming and focuses more on topics of insanity, torture methods, revenge, and self-harm instead of terrorism. However, collaborations between the two genres have happened, such as DON'T OFFEND ME and PINK WATER by 717na.
This term is sometimes used to refer to the GORE STREET collective, which includes artists such as Heptaknot, Yaux, rejectedreyna, and Craig Scissorhands. However, they label their music as Horrorcore or Nu-Horror. This misconception likely arose from the fact they participated in the Torturecore show in Chicago.
While Horrorcore is a subgenre of Hip-Hop that has been around since the 1980s, a new subgenre dubbed ""Nu-Horror"" has been popularized by the collective ""GORE STREET."" The artist rejectedreyna stated in an interview that the name is a combination of ""Nu-Metal"" and ""Horrorcore"" as it combines elements of both genres. A majority of GORE STREET artists used to be associated with the now disbanded trap metal collective ""Hysteria."" Nu-Horror often makes references to serial killers and horror media, and common lyrical topics are kidnapping, necrophilia, mocking the dead, spirituality, the supernatural, torture, drugs, trafficking, and shock sites. Vocal styles also differ quite a bit, with fry and false chord screaming, yelling, and rapping being the main techniques.
Necrotrap and Torturecore/Nu-Horror artists used to collab frequently approximately until 2021, and the boundaries between these three scenes were not completely clear at the time. They began to diverge as accusations of ""plagiarism"" and other controversies caused artists to stop associating with each other, especially due to recurring drama on Twitter and Discord servers.
However, amends were starting to be made in 2023 as NEEDLEGUTS (NECROSOCIETY) collaborated with 717na (trtureprn) on their track PINK WATER, being both a feature and the cover artist. Later on he would collaborate with Heptaknot and Craig Scissorhands (GORE STREET) to create the cover art for GORE STREET SOULJA, and also appeared on Craig Scissorhands's album, ""MR MEATY,"" particularly on the track ""SMOKIN FLESH."" Craig has also appeared on NEEDLEGUTS's account on the track, ""HAPPY CHOP SHOP,"" and has featured SCORN and JACKSAW (IRAQ-A-HOLICS) on the track ""SWIM WITH THE FISHES,"" as well as had some tracks produced by TRYNADIE. Takizava (GORE STREET) has also produced a song named ""human shield,"" which features vocals from artists NEEDLEGUTS and KILLRIDDLE.
Many music sites incorrectly label Trap Metal, Ragecore, Torturecore, and Nu-Horror songs as Necrotrap. In early 2024, Necrosociety and Iraq-a-holics members reposted a story claiming that if you are not part of Necrosociety or at least close to the members, your music is not true Necrotrap. HXLX later expanded on this statement, explaining that it is technically a music brand created by Necrosociety, but it is still possible for artists to make Necrotrap-inspired music, and label it as Necrotrap. However, this has led to the misconception that any sort of loud music with violent themes is Necrotrap. Collectives such as Spider Gang, Hysteria, GORE STREET, KARMAMØB, trtureprn, IDØL, АГОНИЯ, etc. have been incorrectly labeled as ""Necrotrap"" despite the lyrical content being distinct and the vocals and production vastly dissimilar.
Necrotrap has received criticism because its music often draws inspiration from terrorism and violence connected to Middle Eastern paramilitary groups. The genre has a strong component of shock value, and this could present these events in an oversimplified or almost glorified way, potentially giving listeners the wrong idea about these complex issues. Most people see Necrotrap as ran by white American teenagers, despite most of Iraq-a-holics being European adults of varying races. Some critics worry that their understanding of the Middle East and Islamic world might be too superficial to address these topics properly in their lyrics. This could be considered a form of cultural appropriation. Some people have called the lyrics and vocals ""cringe"" or shallow (i.e., shocking for the sake of being shocking).
Necrotrap experienced a slight decline in popularity in late-2022, with GOREJIT, the founder of the genre, quitting and rebranding.[6] Some artists and fans have also chosen to leave the Necrotrap community after bad experiences with each other. Problems like doxxing (sharing someone's private information), scamming others, harassment, child grooming, and the use of racial slurs have happened within the Necrotrap scene. Problematic artists often end up getting a lot of backlash from the rest of the community and subsequently quit. Their music is usually archived on dedicated SoundCloud profiles made by third-parties.
Lastly, there is a minor misconception linking Necrotrap, Torturecore, and Nu-Horror to edgy extremist online groups such as 764. While some members of this group comment under Necrotrap tracks on Soundcloud or YouTube, they are not genuinely related. Necrotrap and other related genres have disturbing lyrics, but they are usually not meant to reflect the actual opinions of the artists. This aspect is unlike 764, which has actually caused real-life harm by engaging in child exploitation and online grooming.
Despite these criticisms, some people involved in the Necrotrap community have positive things to say about it. They find that many of the artists in the scene support each other, welcome new people, and generally try to help each other succeed.",2020s,,"Gore, terrorism, weaponry, creepy figures, shock value","Black, red, white

Nerdcore,https://aesthetics.fandom.com/wiki/Nerdcore,"Nerdcore, not to be confused with Nerd, is a music genre and internet aesthetic that has been around since the late 1990s. The term was first coined by MC Frontalot and he is widely considered to be the originator of the genre. Like many other aesthetics Nerdcore first arose from the eponymous music genre and came to fruition as its own separate aesthetic during the 2000s and 2010s. The aesthetic mostly revolves around 80s-2000s video games, science fiction (Star Wars & Star Trek predominant), role-playing games, tabletop games, internet memes & meme culture, and computer technology.
The driving thrust of Nerdcore is the union of the braggadocius hip-hop attitude with an unabashed love of ""nerdy"" subjects. Instead of being ashamed of being a nerd, Nerdcore artists and fans are proud about it and refuse to hide it or conform to ""weak nerd"" stereotypes.
Notable Nerdcore pioneers include the aforementioned MC Frontalot as well as MC Chris, Schäffer the Darklord, YTCracker, and Sensei Ion.
Nerdcore is primarily expressed in album cover-art, with a heavy emphasis on drawn representations of the artists with a variety of ""nerdy"" accoutrements or background. Some may place the artist inside a familiar-looking video game world, others have the artist in an empty space beset by pieces of technology. Overall the visual references of Nerdcore album covers are predominated by video game references (levels, characters, art) and computer technology references (discs, cables, CRT monitors).
Later Nerdcore shows similarities to Trillwave with visuals that can also have an emphasis on drugs and alcohol, primarily marijuana and beer. Classic aesthetics such as Vaporwave, Old Web, and Nintencore are also common in a lot of Nerdcore media. In some cases, the cover art may be hue-shifted to add purple/blue to the image which enhances the ""wavy"" atmosphere to everything.
Nerdcore music is primarily focused on nerd culture as a whole, ranging from old-school Star Wars references to topical jokes about internet technology or computer programming. What's rapped about varies from artist to artist, with later Nerdcore artists focusing heavily on anime and Japanese pop culture leading to the creation of the Otacore subgenre. Nerdcore is differentiated from Otacore by its broader use of ""nerdy"" references and a stronger focus on Western media.
Nerdcore Hip Hop features beats and styles from multiple Hip-Hop genres, showcasing its diverse crowd of artists. The only similarities between all Nerdcore music is the lyrical content focused on ""nerdy"" subjects.
Nerdcore fashion shares similarities with Nerd fashion, except with the addition of more ""popular"" clothing. Button-up shirts, slacks, and a tie are common elements. The combo of ""nerdy"" graphic t-shirts and a tie is also associated with Nerdcore culture, especially among Nerdcore women. Overall the focus of Nerdcore fashion is expressing yourself without shame, proudly wearing your favorite video game on your shirt. A crossover exists with Hip-Hop fashion in the addition of baggy clothing and snapback hats, a contrast to the normally well-fitted and uptight ""nerd"" look. Other common elements include Vans & Converse shoes, extravagant/bold eyeglass frames, pocket protectors, and hoodies.
Otacore rap features beats and styles from Trillwave primarily. Otacore beats usually feature samples from older video games & anime OSTs, notably from Dragon Ball Zero, Naruto, Final Fantasy, Shiki and more. Otacore songs don't always focus on the struggles of life, hustling, guns and drug talk, and more focus on the more relatable, relaxing aspects of living the ""Otaku life"". However, they can include all of the above, just not as present as Trillwave.
To better describe the lyrics of Otacore, here are various lyrics from a few songs to drive the idea and gist into your minds.

With that being said, Otacore is still very relevant and ever-evolving today with new rappers such as Otaku God and SL!CK taking centre stage with a more drill-sounding, aggressive approach to the previously mostly-trill/laid-back nature of Otacore. Otacore beats have also evolved as well, more drill-style & plug beats started becoming popular in 2018 for Otacore songs VS. the older sounding ""rawer"" sounding beats which were popular back in 2011-2017.",Late 1990s,,"Nerd culture, science fiction, role-playing games, internet memes, 1980s-1990s video games, early internet nostalgia, fantasy, computers",,
Old Emo Art Style,https://aesthetics.fandom.com/wiki/Old_Emo_Art_Style,"The Old Emo Art Style is a type of art style commonly associated with both alternative music genres and the beginning of the internet age, frequently found in art from the 2000s and early 2010s. It has no official name aside from being frequently referred to as the ""2000s emo art style"".
The style was initially characteristic of popular Emo communities (and later the Emo subgenre of Scene) before bleeding into general alternative and mainstream internet spaces. The art style itself is also heavily associated with the animated television series Invader Zim due to its scene influence, and with the rise of anime culture in the 2010s, Japanese shows featuring dark alternative culture such as Death Note became popular references and inspirations for the art style's developing anime-inspired appeal by the turn of the deacade.
The style is characterized by its often sketchy line art. This may be to mimic traditional pencil drawings, or to create a jagged, edgy feel to the artwork. The proportions of the characters were usually thin or stick figured bodies with caricature-like heads and large (often pupil-less) eyes, comparable to the likes of Tim Burton. The large circular eyes are additionally reminiscent of chibi designs of 2000s Japanese TV shows. The character designs mimicked 2000s and early 2010s fashion trends. Low waisted bottoms, straightened opaque high-volume hair, and striped patterns were very popular at the time.",2000s-2010s,,,,
Old Money,https://aesthetics.fandom.com/wiki/Old_Money,"Old Money is an aesthetic based around a wealthy, classic style. Old Money refers to people who have inherited their wealth instead of working for it. In the United States, Old Money is associated with WASP (White Anglo-Saxon Protestant) culture, and in Europe, Old Money is associated with titles of nobility. Old Money is closely associated with the old Preppy aesthetic.
Old Money is always contrasted with New Money, also known as the bourgeoisie, who are middle class but came into wealth rather than being raised in it. As a result, the visual aesthetics of Old Money are to be low-key and subdued in contrast with the supposed ostentation and tackiness of the boujee New Money aesthetic.
In the 2020s, New Money has become an aesthetic prominent on TikTok and Pinterest, which show examples of Old Money lifestyle in photos and videos but are accessed by people who do not come from this background. The fashion of these people is also mimicked by social media accounts, which leads to non-luxury brands mimicking the sophisticated style of this archetype.
Old Money is most prominent in countries where there was no aristocracy but instead an elite social class held a status nearly equal to an aristocracy.
In the United States, the oldest Old Money families are the ones which can trace their ancestry back to the passengers on the Mayflower. Other families are considered Old Money when they can trace their ancestry back to the founders of a prestigious town such as New York City, for example the fictional van der Woodsens in Gossip Girl, who are descendants of Dutch settlers in New York.
The Social Register, a list of the wealthiest and most influential American families was first published in 1887. Some major cities have their own versions of the Social Register. In recent times, it has become less of an indicator of Old Money pedigree.
In the 1930s, Old Money families traced their wealth back to at least the American Revolution. Those who had gained wealth around the time of the American Civil War and during the Gilded Age, were not yet considered Old Money. Today, families whose wealth dates back only to the Gilded Age are considered Old Money.
Blue Blood is a term used to refer to people descended from nobility. Although not all Old Money families have Blue Blood, a family with Blue Blood is more likely to be Old Money than not.
In 1844, the phrase The Upper Ten was used to refer to the 10,000 richest people in New York City. During the Gilded Age, The Four Hundred was used to refer to the four hundred wealthiest families in New York City. The list included the Astors and the Vanderbilts.
Many Old Money families are also WASPs (white Anglo-Saxon Protestants).
The Boston Brahmin, First Families of Virginia, and Old Philadelphians are location-based terms for Old Money groups in the US. They refer to the Old Money families from Boston, Virginia and Philadelphia, whose ancestors were the founders of that respective city or state.
Posh is a term most used in Great Britain to mean a wealthy, upper class person, although the term includes both Old Money and new money. It has spread to other English-speaking locations.
This aesthetic can be described as very sophisticated and classy. The visuals indict wealth and history.
The key is understated elegance. The clothes may appear plain or boring, but they are high quality. Old Money fashion is sometimes confused with Prep, but the color palette is more muted, and black and purple are used. In recent times, the terms ""stealth wealth"" and ""quiet luxury"" have been used to describe the Old Money aesthetic. The terms were first used to describe the clothing worn by characters on the television show Succession, however, these characters are not part of a true Old Money family. In March 2023, Gwyneth Paltrow was praised for her elegant, understated clothing worn for her court appearances.
Media focusing on Old Money tends to contrast the wealth of the lifestyle with darker themes like murder, tragic deaths, depression, and drug and alcohol abuse. Characters often have difficultly expressing real emotions due to not being shown the love of a parent during childhood.
Another common element is the conflict between Old Money characters and New Money, or Nouveau Riche, characters. Media often centers around conflict with individuals who were not born into pedigreed families and made their fortunes recently, such as on Wall Street or in show business. Old Money characters often look down on New Money because of their ostentatious displays of wealth, and use it as evidence as to why their money is inferior.",,,,"Beige, brown, pink, black, white, blue, green",
Pastel Gore,https://aesthetics.fandom.com/wiki/Pastel_Gore,"Pastel Gore is an internet aesthetic that essentially consists of gory artwork where the subject is unusually gooey, colorful and even cute, often using pastel colours. It may replace creepier Gore elements like organs or blood with candy and slime, and ocasionally it may use elements of Body Horror. Pastel Gore is influenced by Gurokawa and Pastel Goth fashion and it has various subgenres, including Candy Gore.
The aesthetic was at its peak during the late 2010s and it was especially popular among Gen Z tweens and teens, forming online communities in platforms such as Amino, Tumblr and the former Sony Sketch.
Examples of the Pastel Gore aesthetic may include graphic imagery like blood, guts and all sorts of gore (playing into the macabre part of the word) but depicted in a light, cartoonish way. A musical artist who particularly popularized the Pastel Gore aesthetic is Jack Stauber, and one of the earliest works that somewhat resembles this aesthetic is the web series Happy Tree Friends.
As indicated by the name, the Pastel Gore aesthetic often times involves characters wearing vividly or saturated pastel colored outfits.
Candy Gore, despite being an aesthetic very similiar to Pastel Gore, may use any colour palette and a broad range of colours. The main motifs used in Candy Gore include organs or blood replaced with candy (including melting candy), sugar or other sweet foods. Sometimes it also includes references to hearts or stars.

Pastels,https://aesthetics.fandom.com/wiki/Category:Pastels,"Pastel is an aesthetic that relates to pastel colors. Pastels are also known as tints, and are pale tones of colors made by mixing a significant amount of white into the original shade. The pastel colors can be created by adding white, and the more white adding into the original shade, the paler the pastel will be.[1] They can tie into multiple aesthetics, like pastel fashion. They're commonly linked with Kawaii and cute culture. Pastel images often have a dreamy, soft appearance to them, since pastel colors can be easy on the eyes, and evoke feelings of calmness and nostalgia.
Although most commonly associated with fashion and art, stationery, pastel colored food, décor, and in some cases, stylistic landscape/photography.
In the 1980s, there was a trend of pastel colors in men's fashion. In particular, the NBC television police series Miami Vice popularized what was already a growing trend even further as its lead character Sonny Crockett (Don Johnson) exclusively wore pastel shirts and suits, setting a fashion that stood popular years after the show ended. The abundance of pastel was, and still is, also visible in the shooting locations with Art Deco buildings around the Miami area.
Currently, pastels are often associated with kids and/or girls. They are can be seen on baby clothes, as well.",,,"Calmness, nostalgia",Any colors,
Peoplehood,https://aesthetics.fandom.com/wiki/Peoplehood,"Peoplehood is an aesthetic revolving around common acts of kindness and intimacy that are present in daily life. Popularized as ""Peoplehood"" on Tumblr[citation needed] and related to ""Slice of life,"" this aesthetic stems from a shared admiration for poetry, quotes from literature, music, and artworks that exalt human connection. There is heavy emphasis on creating patterns between certain imagery and motifs through moodboards and compilations/parallels/web-weaving (explained below). Certain works have become incredibly well-known and venerated in those circles, with those being the subject of many compilations and even memes. Some of the most popular include: ""The Orange"" by Wendy Cope, multiple Ocean Vuong poems, and ""The Two-Headed Calf"" by Laura Gilpin.
Peoplehood is a continuation of the yearning culture present in Dark Academia and Cottagecore communities, as well as the sentiment present on TikTok about being the ""main character"" in one's own life and the necessity of romanticization for positive mental health.
Many of the photos and videos popularized in the community were taken without the knowledge or consent of the subjects involved, which is a violation of privacy.

Phony Bureaucracy,https://aesthetics.fandom.com/wiki/Phony_Bureaucracy,"Phony Bureaucracy is a term used to describe the aesthetic of unsettling but ultimately phony bureaucratic and informational media. These can include posters, videos, broadcasts, letters, or any other forms of media that follow the aesthetics of official (often government) propaganda, except that they are sinister in tone, ominously describing nightmarish or unworldly events. Many aesthetics, such as Analog Horror and Cryptidcore, contain elements of Phony Bureaucracy as a way of worldbuilding or reinforcing a feeling of ""wrongness,"" but this specific aesthetic can also be found in more humorous contexts, such as the 2011 puzzle-platform Portal 2. There is also some overlap with work from online creators such as Alan Wagner (although not all of his work should be considered Phony Bureaucracy).
The effectiveness of this technique may come from the familiar authority and coldness of authoritative media being juxtaposed with a sinister or threatening scenario. Arguably, the most effective examples of this aesthetic are pieces of media that could be mistaken as real. Fear of emergency alert systems in general may contribute to this feeling of unease.",,,,,EAS Brain Control Scenario from Alert World on YouTube.
Pink Parisian,https://aesthetics.fandom.com/wiki/Pink_Parisian,"Pink Parisian is a girly aesthetic that takes influence from mid-twentieth century Paris and similar cities, luxury brands, ‘chic’ French fashion, and Old Hollywood movies that is largely collected on Tumblr blogs that have a pink theme. The participants emphasize the importance of self-care, romanticizing small pleasures in life, and cultivating a sophisticated and kind personality. While it does resemble other luxury-based aesthetics such as Boujee, its hyperfeminine presentation, vintage lifestyle elements, and lack of necessity to actually purchase luxury items distinguishes itself from others. It is somewhat a more hyperfeminine version of French It Girl and is somewhat related to Shoe Diva.
This community was popular on Tumblr in the 2010s, and they did not call themselves by this name. Rather, they use multiple tags such as ""pink,"" ""French,"" and ""luxury"" to find similar blogs.
As the aesthetic was developed by fashion brands from the 1930s-1960s, most of the pieces included take direct inspiration from Chanel, Dior, and Louis Vuitton. Followers of Vintage Parisian also seek to emulate movie stars such as Audrey Hepburn and Marilyn Monroe, as well as some modern hyper-feminine characters and celebrities such as Blair Waldorf and Ariana Grande. In line with the lifestyle that emphasizes relaxation and romance, there is a strong emphasis on wearing lingerie and loungewear. The colors involved are black and white, red, pastels, and precious metals. Multiple textures include: satin, velvet, lace, wool, tweed, marabou feathers, fur, and high-end linen.
Fashion pieces include:
Perfume is a large component of this aesthetic; not only the fragrance itself, but also the perfume bottles which are oftentimes displayed as decor or photographed as part of a vanity display with other cosmetic items (makeup, skin care, etc.). The fragrances popular with this aesthetic mainly come from French perfume houses (Chanel, Dior, Guerlain, Yves Saint Laurent, etc.) and have simple and elegant packaging. High-end designer brand perfume is expensive and therefore seen as luxurious, adding to its appeal in this aesthetic.
The Parisian and general city influences of the style give a strong emphasis to architecture, which features prominently on blogs. Luxurious pre-WW1 buildings in Paris are the most popular, with a deep appreciation for the elaborate crown molding and white walls. Famous buildings such as The Ritz Paris, the Tiffany & Co. store in New York City, and Laduree stores are very popular due to their connections with celebrities and film, their French aesthetic, and the luxurious atmosphere. Rococo buildings, such as the Hôtel de Soubise or some interiors of the Palace of Versailles, are also reblogged, typically in snowy winter photographs.
The Pink Parisian aesthetic is focused especially on the architecture of the Belle Époque (a period usually dated to be between 1871–1880 and the outbreak of World War I in 1914), mainly Beaux Arts, Louis XVI Revival/Neo-Louis XVI and Rococo Revival/Neo-Rococo apartment buildings. Besides late 19th century and very early 20th century architecture, this aesthetic is also influenced by 17th and 18th century hôtel particuliers, built in the Baroque, Rococo and Louis XVI styles. Examples include Hôtel de La Guiche, Hôtel Biron, Hôtel de Soubise and Hôtel Matignon (all of these examples are in Paris). It's important to keep in mind that, despite how they are called, they were not hotels, but permanent residences for aristocrats. Similar residences were also built during the 19th century, like Hôtel d'Hautpoul or Hôtel du Rond-Point (both in Paris).
Home decor is inspired by Parisian apartments, fashion designers ateliers, and hotel rooms in luxury hotels.
As 1930s-1960s is the most popular time period associated with the style, music from these decades, especially in French, is popular. However, contemporary musicians that have a hyper-feminine persona and sing about unrequited love and luxury are also featured in some playlists.",1930s-1960s,,"Luxury goods, perfume, make-up, roses, vintage movies, jazz music, love, French cuisine","Black, white, gold, and pink",
Pink Pilates Princess,https://aesthetics.fandom.com/wiki/Pink_Pilates_Princess,"A Pink Pilates Princess is defined on Urban Dictionary as ""a girl who spends her time working out, making green juices and smoothies and chugs green tea every night"". In short, the Pink Pilates Princess aesthetic is a girlier version of the That Girl aesthetic; featuring elements of the Coquette(specifically Dollette and Waif) , Balletcore, Clean Girl, Wonyoungism, and VS angel aesthetics, as well as girly and hyperfeminine aesthetics in general. There is great emphasis placed on one's wellness journey, pulling it off in a head to toe model off-duty, yet still hyper-feminine look.[1]
The roots of this aesthetic are said to lie in 2000s fashion, or in the McBling era. [1] The arrival of Frankie's Bikinis: Pilates Princess collection, launched this niche aesthetic into the fame. The inspirations behind the collection was clear as it has been described to “infuse ballet fashion with trendy athleisure to create functional and feminine apparel for your everyday lifestyle–whether you’re working out, running errands, or lounging around.” ([2] This collection included a variety of pastel pink pieces, workout gear and razorback dresses.[3].",,,,"Pastel Pink, White, Silver, Pastels,",
Politicalwave,https://aesthetics.fandom.com/wiki/Politicalwave,"Politicalwave is an umbrella term for closely related internet aesthetics that use visual elements of Vaporwave and Synthwave with propagandistic intentions. Unlike the other subgenres of the latter, they mainly focus on spreading an agenda and specific visuals rather than developing a distinctive musical style.
As an umbrella term, Politicalwave emcompasses multiple aesthetics based around a broad set of political ideologies, and may sometimes clash with each other. Some infamous genres part of the umbrella include Laborwave, Fashwave, Militarywave, among many others. A criticism of Politicalwave aesthetics is that they can be considered a form of propaganda for controversial radical ideologies and authoritarian regimes, attempting to appeal to a younger audience familiar with retro-themed aesthetics and electronic music genres. This practice aligns with the concept of the aestheticization of politics.
The term ""Politicalwave"" was first used by a small subreddit of the same name,[1] and in fact, many of these styles were mainly popularized on Reddit, TikTok and YouTube. Although most of them were created during the late 2010s, The rise of these aesthetics is inherently related to the phenomenom of political polarization during the 2020s, and this includes online propaganda directed at teenagers on social media.
The first political aesthetic trying to replicate Synthwave is thought to be Fashwave, which was first widely reported in 2016[2] as an alt-right attempt to infiltrate the Synthwave and Vaporwave communities, although it was met with strong disapproval. Then, after it became infamous, more people started to form communities based around the same concept but using their own personal agendas and ideas. Some of these genres have been covered as sources of indoctrination because they try to appeal to young, vulnerable audiences.
Vaporwave itself has always had political elements, although the aesthetic itself isn't always a political statement. The visuals of Vaporwave can easily be interpreted as a way to satirize late-stage Capitalism, as well as consumerism in society. This political element of the aesthetic has therefore inspired subgenres like Laborwave, which exploit that aspect to promote a Communist agenda.
Apart from that, other aesthetics like Fashwave were simply attacks on the Synthwave community; people of alt-right ideologies attempted to make the aesthetic become associated with Fascism or Nazism and hate speech, although they failed to do so because they confused Synthwave with Vaporwave and they were quickly pushed back by the true community. Other aesthetics simply surged on Reddit as a way to promote an agenda with the estabilished motifs of the former. Neo-Nazis trying to co-opt aesthetics with hate speech is nothing new: they also tried to do the same thing with Cottagecore and Punk, and even Nazi Chic, which was meant to be apart of the Punk movement and used in a satirical way but it was later reclaimed by Neo-Nazis.
An example of Anarchowave.
Anarchowave, as a portmanteau of ""anarcho-"" and ""-wave,"" is an aesthetic used to promote Anarchism and pretty much all of its sub-ideologies. It combines some of the traditional elements of Synthwave with glitchy and distorted visuals and imagery relating to the Anarchist ideology, including historical figures, riots, uprisings, etc. It often criticizes modern society and Capitalism.
An Anarchowave edit of the C.N.T-F.A.I in Catalonia.
Anarchowave edits usually feature imagery related to Anarchist organizations and pictures relating to insurrections and rebellions against authority, including but not limited to the CNT-FAI, the Revolutionary Insurrectionary Army of Ukraine, the Commune of Paris, etc. These images, unlike traditional Synthwave, are edited with heavy glitch effects and other elements to create a sense of chaos, as well as famous phrases that Anarchist politicians have said. Although rarely ever classified as a musical subgenre of Vaporwave, there's a few songs and tracks that could classify Anarchowave as a niche microgenre, such as M A K H N O W A V E ブラックアーミー by Korach.
An image depicting Nigel Farage drinking next to the flag of England.
Faragewave (sometimes also called Brexitwave) is an aesthetic that originated as a meme glorifying Nigel Farage, a British politician and leader of Reform UK, the right-wing populist political party of the United Kingdom responsible for ""Brexit."" The earliest examples of this meme date back to videos uploaded to YouTube in October 2016, although the aesthetic resurged in June 2024, especially in the context of political elections during the same year. This aesthetic often showcases conservativism, British or English nationalism, and ""optimism"" for the future.
An image depicting the Fashwave aesthetic's themes and motifs.
Born from being rejected by the larger mainstream Synthwave community, Fashwave was an attempt to take established Synthwave motifs and sounds and combine them with imagery often associated with the larger Neo-Nazism and White Supremacy movements. While it saw an uptick in activity in the late 2010s, it has seemingly seen its traction ground to a screeching halt after several musicians in the movement got banned from streaming platforms for everything ranging from the overt references to fascism and white supremacy to accusations of outright plagiarism of smaller artists within the Synthwave fanbase as a whole. A similar issue happened with the Cottagecore community, as alt-righters attempted to co-opt the aesthetic.
Common Fashwave motifs include hate symbols, such as the Schwarze Sonne, 14/88 (a reference to the Fourteen Words, a white supremacist slogan, with 88 standing for HH/Heil Hitler) and various figures, both fascist and non-fascist (with Hitler being the most popular one, followed by Donald Trump and Mussolini). This also influenced the Hyperborean aesthetic, which uses similiar symbology. Fashwave can also confusingly implement Vaporwave motifs, which makes it come off as if the people in the community can't tell the difference between Synthwave and Vaporwave outside of both drawing heavy inspiration from the 80s and early 90s.
Main article: Hyperborean
A Hyperborean edit featuring the catchphrase ""cover yourself in oil,"" from the Trollge meme.
Hyperborean (also known as ""Schizowave"" or ""Schizoposting"") is an aesthetic really similar to Fashwave, although with an identity distinct enough of its own. Named after the Ancient Greek legend of ""Hyperborea,"" it uses visual elements relating to Esoteric Nazism (essentially the same thing as Neo-Nazism, but with mythological elements), beliefs in ""superior races"" or higher deities and Nordic aliens, internet memes like Trollge, conspiracy theories (especially from the pre-Soviet period), rampant anti-Semitism, and an anti-immigration bias. The symbology is overall identical to that of Fashwave, with the ""black sun"" being the most used symbol in Hyperborean edits, but it incorporates a sense of derealization and mythological motifs that sets it apart from the typical Vaporwave and Synthwave motifs. The use of dog whistles is also extremely common in this aesthetic, which internet accounts use to recognize each other. There have also been instances where they have appropiated Eurodance, Nightcore, Scenecore, or Hands Up songs by calling them ""Aryan Classics,"" a practice that has been criticized by the fans of these music genres because they don't want to be associated with radical political movements. This specific subgenre has also been criticized for stigmatizing schizophrenia, since most people participating in it are not actually diagnosed with that condition and only use it as a disguise for their hateful beliefs.

Militarywave is an aesthetic that glorifies and promotes the military and, in some cases, paramilitary forces. Primarily found on platforms like YouTube and TikTok, it utilizes military footage (including clips from films, historical re-enactments, and video games) edited with VHS filters, glitch effects, and music such as Drift Phonk, House Phonk, and Russian Phonk (see Driftcore). The aesthetic often presents a positive view of military institutions, and while not explicitly tied to a singular political ideology, it frequently aligns with authoritarian and right-wing themes.
""WE EARNED OUR FLAG!"" - Military Edit
An homophobic propaganda edit implying that the LGBT+ community ""didn't fight"" for a flag, unlike the military. The video description tries to promote Nationalism.
This aesthetic has been criticizing for its glorified portrayal of the military and its involvement with ""cringe culture."" Critics point to instances where the aesthetic has been used to promote exclusionary narratives, particularly regarding the LGBTQ+ community. Examples include videos contrasting the military with the LGBTQ+ community, implying a perceived conflict between the two. This portrayal overlooks the presence of LGBTQ+ individuals serving in the military and the historical contributions of the LGBTQ+ community to civil rights movements. Furthermore, there are concerns about the aesthetic's tendency to exclude women and non-white soldiers from its representations. The presentation of historical events within Militarywave has also been criticized for its propagandistic and potentially inaccurate nature. Critics argue that it often glorifies historical conflicts without acknowledging the difficulties and traumas associated with war. This can lead to an oversimplified understanding of history, particularly among younger audiences.
Mainly overlapping with the followers of Andrew Tate and the Polandball or Countryballs fandom, as well as the Anti-Furry and TikTok Mapping communities, the aesthetic also faces criticism because they portray historical events in a propagandistic and unauthentic way. Those who partake in Militarywave aesthetic often don't actually learn history and they just glorify it because they think it's ""cool"" or ""edgy."" A crucial part of learning history is not repeating the mistakes that our ancestors commited in the past, but instead, they ignore that aspect and glorify events such as World War II or simply have distorted views of what happened during these times. They also tend to overlook the trauma that many soldiers who participated in war went through, and this is reflected in how they stereotype veterans as ""strong"" or ""real"" men.
The aesthetic's association with figures like Andrew Tate and online communities such as Polandball/Countryballs, Anti-Furry, and TikTok Mapping has also drawn criticism. There are concerns that Militarywave may contribute to the dissemination of pro-military propaganda to a young and impressionable audience.
On June 29, 2024, Rishi Sunak, the prime minister of the United Kingdom from 2022 to 2024, posted an edit glorifying the British military on X,[3] some days before his position as the prime minister was succeded by Keir Starmer. The video featured the song ""Little Dark Age"" by MGMT. This event highlighted how political figures may attempt to leverage the aesthetic to appeal to younger demographics, though the post was met with widespread online criticism and mockery.
An example of Monarchowave, portraying Kaiser William II and Franz Joseph I of Austria.
Monarchowave, as a portmanteau of ""Monarcho-"" and ""-wave,"" is an aesthetic that originated in early 2020 on the subreddit r/monarchism, and like the name implies, it uses the visuals of Synthwave and Vaporwave to promote Monarchism and the royalty. It is quite similiar to Tradwave because it also implements traditional elements and anti-modernism, although it's not as heavy about religion as Tradwave.
It started out as a niche edit genre, although it later gained some traction on Reddit. Sometimes overlapping with Royalcore, Monarchowave edits often portray images of European kings and queens, as well as Russian tsars or German kaisers. VHS filters, censored eyes, bright colour filters and flags historically related to Monarchism are quite common in the visuals.
An example of NATOwave, showing the NATO headquarters.
NATOwave is an aesthetic focusing on the interventionist political ideology and the promotion of NATO (North Atlantic Treaty Organization). Various interventionist tendencies depict conflicting ideologies within the movement with some praising NATO only as a collective defence force, while others embrace a more Neo-Conservative or Hawkish agenda, focusing on anti-communism, cold war conflicts and political figures such as George Walker Bush, the 43rd president of the United States of America.
Despite being inspired by Fashwave and Laborwave, which correspond to the extremes of the political spectrum, NATOwave rather aligns with the political center and incorporates ideas that these movements tend to oppose such as modernity, liberal thought and globalism, while rejecting radical and populist political ideology almost entirely. NATOwave is often thought of specifically as a contrarian response to these movements, or reclaiming the Synthwave and Vaporwave aesthetics from online extremists.
N A T O W A V E -NatoWave
The first known mention of NATOwave was on a video uploaded by the YouTube user Schizo Pilled on February 19th, 2021. Titled N A T O W A V E, the video features war footage, particularly footage of fighter jets and tanks, edited with a VHS-like Synthwave filter along with the song Little Dark Age by MGMT playing on the background (in fact, that song came to be associated with politically motivated edits and aesthetics at some point).[4]
Two months later on April 19th, the r/NATOwave subreddit was created, for the purpose of sharing pro-NATO edits, memes and Vaporwave mixes. NATOwave started to see an uptick in popularity in 2022 following the Russian invasion of Ukraine, and the creation of Pro-Ukrainian and Pro-Taiwanese content soon followed.
A Laborwave moodboard.
Laborwave is an aesthetic that emerged within certain far-left circles that is less subtle about its critiques of Capitalism and takes advantage of this aspect of Vaporwave to promote a Communist or Socialist agenda, being supportive of extremist ideologies such as Marxism-Leninism, Stalinism, Maoism, Juche and in rare cases, National Bolshevism or Anarcho-Communism. The Laborwave scene is characterized by its focus on themes such as class struggle, anti-capitalism, Marxism and far-left revolutions, being common among its edits political symbols like the Red Star or the Hammer and Sickle. While other Politicalwave aesthetics often incorporate Synthwave, Laborwave is almost always based on Vaporwave.
-VAPORWAVE- Red sun in the sky - Chinese Communist Music 天上太阳红衫衫-2
A ""Vaporwave"" remix of ""Red Sun in the Sky,"" a Chinese communist propaganda song.
Laborwave music mostly consists of slowed-down versions of popular songs from communist states/organizations such as the Soviet Union, the People's Republic of China, North Korea, the Naxalites, the Shining Path, and the Khmer Rouge, somehow managing to make the instruments sound like popular Vaporwave staples, although without being otherwise transformative with it. Much as Fashwave, its visual component of consists of Retro-Futuristic imagery, including neon colors or palm trees, with references to communist symbology such the Hammer and Sickle, or imagery associated with communist or far-left political figures like Vladimir Lenin, Joseph Stalin, Mao Zedong, Fidel Castro or Kim Il-Sung. Socialist figures such as Hugo Chávez, Bashar al-Assad or Muammar Gaddafi have been also depicted among its edits.
Laborwave is sometimes confused with Sovietwave due to their focus on aesthetics related to Communism and anti-capitalism, although they're pretty different visually and musically. Laborwave often uses quite ironic and absurdist visuals in its portrayal of Soviet Nostalgia, while Sovietwave is almost entirely limited to the former USSR and is a more sincere form of nostalgia for the long gone Red Regime. Sovietwave tends to replicate Soviet utopian art earnestly, longing for the future that was promised, and is more fond of expressing awe at the might of the Soviet Union, while Laborwave tends to make fun of such propaganda and grandiose expressions even if Laborwave adherents are serious about being pro-communist. Additionally, Sovietwave music counts as a niche subgenre of Synthwave, while Laborwave simply takes clues from Vaporwave.
An edit based around American Libertarianism.
As a portmanteau of ""liberty"" and ""-wave,"" Libertywave is an almost entirely visual-based subgenre that has a heavy focus on right-leaning and liberty-promoting ideologies, which much like Fashwave, often confuses the Synthwave and Vaporwave aesthetics. It is closely related to Anarchowave, another political subgenre that also focuses on anti-authority but with an obvious approach/perception and tactics typically associated with left-wing groups.
This edit portrays the socialist ideology as an evil red person.
Although predominantly associated with the political situation of the United States, it is also shared by other nations worldwide who are in the same circumstances about their own countries or governments, etc. It is a niche subgenre, and some motifs associated with the aesthetic include depictions of Libertarianism, the American Revolution and anti-authoritarian and anti-socialist imagery, which might sometimes cross the line into hate speech towards other people with different political affiliations.

Serbwave is a political aesthetic that surged as a meme in online communities such as YouTube and Discord, and as its name implies, it's based around Serbian nationalism, the paramilitary of Republika Srpska, and Yugoslavian nostalgia. Users who partake in this aesthetic usually take videos related to the Yugoslav Wars and Turbofolk war songs from Republika Srpska (an entity of Bosnia and Herzegovina) and remix them to resemble Vaporwave or Synthwave.
This subaesthetic is often akin to Fashwave and Laborwave, but it's important to note that most people who participate on Serbwave are not actually Serbian, many of them just find the war-related topics ""edgy"" or ""cool."" Similar to Balkan Violence Tumblr, it takes imagery from the Yugoslav Wars, one of the bloodiest conflicts in modern European history, hence why this aesthetic has been deemed insensitive by some citizens of the countries involved. A YouTube user notable for uploading multiple music videos and edits related to Serbwave is TheAthelasProject, who is actually from Montenegro and not Serbia or Republika Srpska.
Not to be confused with Yugowave, which depicts a more sincere form of nostalgia for Yugoslavia.
An example of Tradwave depicting a Catholic procession of the Lord of the Miracles in Lima, Peru.
Tradwave is an aesthetic used to promote traditionalism and Catholicism. Tradwave usually uses traditional Catholic paintings, sculptures, or photographs of saints, given with Vaporwave effects, often with a bible verse or quote about Catholicism. The art usually tries to convey a resurrection of Catholic spirituality in the modern atheist-leaning world. Figures often depicted in Tradwave edits or art include Jesus Christ, the Virgin Mary, Ven. Fulton Sheen, Cardinal Robert Sarah, and Mother Angelica.
Tradwave music often takes the form of two main styles. One of them is catholic hymns with Vaporwave effects and traditional Vaporwave or Lo-Fi music. It can also have quotes from modern prolific Catholic figures, such as Ven. The other theme is Fulton Sheen and Cardinal Robert Sarah.","Late 2010s

Poster Gal,https://aesthetics.fandom.com/wiki/Poster_Gal,"Poster Gal, also known as Y2K Chibi, is an aesthetic that was popular around roughly 2002 to 2013. It is often described as a more feminine and nerdier version of Olderbrothercore. Its main motifs are anime-inspired art styles and pop culture from that time period.
The Poster Gal art style can best be described as a heavily stylized and exaggerated Chibi art style with Western animation influence. It contain distinctive features that are difficult to perfectly replicate with modern tools and techniques, such as low quality airbrush shading or visible pixels; these features contribute to the dated look of Poster Gal art. Other common features include:
Poster gals would also make ID cards, which usually featured
An example of a Poster Gal styled ID Card. Most were edited digitally, unlike this one, however.
The term Poster Gal was coined in late 2023 by Shade Amburgey (NekoRikiRawrr). The name derives from how Poster Gals would cover their walls in posters, photos of their favorite actors, and fan art of their favorite characters, hence earning them the title of ""poster gal"".
While the Poster Gal aesthetic originated in the late 1990s, it only got more prevalent in the early 2000s with the advent of the art-sharing website deviantART in August 2000. As sharing art on the Internet began getting easier, massive numbers of teenage artists with internet access joined the website in droves and began to post images. Most were geeks and otaku who drew in a modified anime art style that combined anime with the style of Western cartoons such as Tiny Toon Adventures or Invader Zim
Many of the most famous artists now associated with Poster Gal joined deviantART in 2002-03, such as Brianna Garcia, a.k.a. Bri-Chan, who joined in 2003. She is considered the most notable Poster Gal artist and instantly gained a following.
Due to the success of Brianna Garcia’s works, many artists began to copy and build upon her style, eventually creating the Poster Gal art style. As NekoRikiRawrr says, “Bri-Chan was the new thing, everyone was hopping in to also make it big like she did.” While Poster Gal existed before Bri-Chan and many Poster Gal artists seemingly were not influenced by her works, Bri-Chan’s success is credited with popularizing the style and inspiring the creation of many of its most famous works, which became an aspect of the general interests of the community's geeky teenage girl audience.
Around 2004-06, Bri-Chan began to distance herself from Poster Gal art and started to explore other styles, but some of the artists who became popular during Bri-Chan’s rise in popularity and did not evolve their style still continued to use Poster Gal in their art. Eventually, Brianna Garcia got a job at Disneyland and stopped drawing Poster Gal styled art completely.
An offshoot of Poster Gal known as Kawaii Warrior began appearing in 2009, with the goal of preserving the legacy of the aesthetic. It combined a less refined Poster Gal art style with bright, colorful characters often described as “Sparkle-dogs”. Unlike the Poster Gal aesthetic, Kawaii Warrior remains prominent to this day.
By the mid-2010s, the anime trend of deviantART had begun to recede, and most of the artists associated with the aesthetic had left the website or had a evolved a different art style. While Kawaii Warrior was still prevalent, it was more common on websites such as YouTube, which is the origin of many animation memes.
Around 2023, Brianna Garcia began deleting her photos, many of which were Poster Gal artworks, before deleting her deviantART account entirely. After this, NekoRikiRawrr started her own deviantART account to archive her works. The archive ended up being banned and moved to the Web Archive in July of 2024
Poster Gal music mostly consists of the popular alternative and rock music of the era, along with the music many deviantART users of the period listed in the 'Favorite Musician' tab of their profile. Genres commonly associated with it include:

Princesscore,https://aesthetics.fandom.com/wiki/Princesscore,"Princesscore is an aesthetic based on the life, fashion, and mannerisms of a princess, specifically historical European princesses and Fairytale princesses. It is a subgenre of Royalcore. It is about the visual: looking like a princess, but also the behavior: being poised, educated and well-mannered, but most importantly, having all the qualities to take reign. The main subtype of Princesscore is Pink Princess.
The atmosphere is strongly linked to the position of a princess, because it reflects the cultural traditions and various aspects of her life. Besides, this asks or answers various questions about her status and unknown future. Unlike the Queencore aesthetic, Princesscore usually doesn't make decisions or changes to the internal politics or the economy but is learning about it so that one day they can. It is worth noting that depending on the region where the princess comes from, the set of words linked to the position can change greatly.
Although generalized, some possible, relatable things can be:
As one may expect of an aesthetic so named, Princesscore fashion takes its inspiration from real royalty, especially princesses and queens, and fictional representations.

Queencore,https://aesthetics.fandom.com/wiki/Queencore,"Queencore is a more mature, regal variant of Princesscore and a subgenre of Royalcore.
Queencore, as a whole, draws from matriarchal and regal roles in many monarchies. One example of such would be the former Queen of England, Elizabeth II, and Princess Diana, of England and Wales both. As being the head of a monarchy, a queen would have to lead one's country through hardships such as famine and wars. This guidance leads to an air of regalia as they handle these issues with grace and care for their peoples.
Although this style is very historically inspired, it can be used to inspire modern looks.
Most visuals can be taken from castle exteriors, interiors, and grounds. This can include throne rooms, royal chambers, and gardens. Examples include:
Fashion may be taken directly from historical accounts or may be modernized. Real life examples can include historical figures like Queen Victoria for a more historical approach, or figures like Kate Middleton and Meghan Markle for more modern fashion. Fictional examples can include Queen Calanthe from The Witcher, Cersei Lannister from Game of Thrones, Mary, Queen of Scots from Reign, and The Countess from American Horror Story (for a more creative twist). Staples include intricate embroidery, beading, jewel and metal embellishments, darker or richer colors, and long sleeves. Suggestions include:

Renewable Corporate Utopia,https://aesthetics.fandom.com/wiki/Renewable_Corporate_Utopia,"Renewable Corporate Utopia (RCU) also known as Stock Eco Office, Stecoffism, or Solargraphic is a subgenre of Frutiger Eco and Corporate. Renewable Corporate Utopia promoted environmental positivity during a time when global warming was (and still is) a great issue. It combines the utopic, humanist, naturist themes of Frutiger Eco with Corporate office based imagery and values. The best way to describe this would essentially just be Frutiger Eco if you took out the “Frutiger”. RCU came to prominence in the early-2010s and lost popularity in the late-2010s with the rise of Corporate Memphis.
Renewable Corporate Utopia came to prominence around the early-2010s around the downfall of Frutiger Aero and the rise of Post-Morphism. It aimed to combine the Corporate Workplace aesthetic with the simultaneously eco-friendly and utopian Frutiger Eco. This was a product of the environmentalist themes of the era triggered by global warming and climate change fears, similar to Frutiger Eco's background.
RCU was used prominently among many companies throughout the 2010s, but slowly started dying down in favor of the rising popularity of Corporate Memphis around the late-2010s/early-2020s. Although not used as commonly in advertising, many RCU images are still prominent today in media such as school textbooks and corporate marketing as it is a simple but effective way of displaying an eco-utopic future with consumer-friendly values that make it optimistic and timeless.
Renewable Corporate Utopia combines the utopic, humanist, and naturist themes of Frutiger Eco with Corporate office based imagery and values. People featured in RCU images tend to display neatness, presentability, and looking ""sharp"". Related fonts are typically rounded and with a lot of negative space. Some examples include Avenue, Futura, Century, Gothic, Raleway, Nunito, Quicksand, Cumulus, Caviar-Dreams, etc.. Prominent colors featured in RCU include: dale & deep green, white, baby blue & blue, cyan, turquoise, teal, pale yellow, light orange and grey. Architecturally, RCU emphasizes clean, open office spaces, windows, elevated spaces, bright lighting, and greenery, with greenwall a particularly common trope.
Imagery is of the typical faceless, emotionless corporate pablu typem, but with an environmental bent:
Renewable Corporate Utopia has a heavy focus on Corporate imagery and themes, largely omitting the glossy, abstract flourishes or themes of Frutiger Aero. Despite this, RCU still retains the naturistic, iconographic, humanistic and 3D render motifs of Frutiger Eco. Much like Bright Tertiaries, RCU also leans toward company architecture, industrial iconography, geometry, vector graphics, holographics, minimalism, and often even the use of empty semi-liminal space,
Overall, RCU heavily emphasises the corporate side of Frutiger Eco, while omitting the abstract dreamlike imagery characteristic of Frutiger Aero.",,,,,
Rockstar GF,https://aesthetics.fandom.com/wiki/Rockstar_GF,"The Rockstar Girlfriend or Rockstar GF aesthetic is one that seeks to emulate the 24/7 lifestyles and clothing styles of the girlfriends of famous rock musicians [1]. This style combines elements of edgy and Grunge/Soft Grunge fashion with feminine and romantic touches. This effortlessly cool look is often inspired by the fashions of the '70s, '80s, and 90s. All in all, it includes many components of the Downtown Girl, Messy French Girl, Model-Off Duty, Indie Sleaze, Dark Coquette, and Riot Grrrl aesthetics.
This aesthetic is one that rose in popularity through TikTok. In post-lockdown 2022, the idea of hedonism and non-stop partying has naturally made its comeback[1]. The Rockstar GF aesthetic encapsulates this idea, and much more.
Although this aesthetic has risen in popularity recently, the aesthetic has existed for much longer. As Sophie Wilson writes for The Face, “The rockstar girlfriend has existed for as long as the modern rockstar. In the 1960s, OG rockstar girlfriends Anita Pallenberg and Pattie Boyd dated members of the Rolling Stones and the Beatles [...]”[1]
Side note: Though the two are inherently linked, the Rockstar Girlfriend trope and Rockstar GF aesthetic are different. The trope refers to the stereotype and idea of the rockstar girlfriend in the culture, while the aesthetic is merely the visual representation of the trope. Essentially, the aesthetic includes the styles and fashions, while the trope is the person behind these.
The origins of the trope date back to the early 1960's (as mentioned before). The girlfriends/wives of the biggest rock stars in the 60’s and 70’s (such as Pricilla Presley, Bianca Jagger, and June Carter Cash) didn't have the style and energy that we would associate with a 'rockstar girlfriend'. Although many of these women were involved in the party scenes (which is a mainstay of the aesthetic), they were, comparatively, much more proper and 'ladylike' than their later counterparts; as was the norm for women in the early 60s/late 50's. These women were seen as more of a 'wife' than a girlfriend. [2]
The modern idea of the dark and gritty rockstar girlfriend comes from the late 60's/early 70's. The women who embodied this aesthetic were Nancy Spongen, Mayte Garcia, Pamela Anderson and Courtney Love. This is when we see a shift away from 'wife' and more towards 'girlfriend'[2].
Most notably, groupie culture is what led to this aesthetic's creation. Groupies are young women who hang around musicians and try to have sex with them. They typically are superfans of these musicians, but have a more charismatic and hedonistic persona in comparison to fangirls; having a ""cool"" persona and attractive looks that would catch the attention of the musician is the main goal of this group. Being able to get backstage and speak to the musician is a validation of their coolness and a status symbol for these women, while a musician having groupies is a status symbol for his popularity.
The main colors of the aesthetic are black, white, and variations on the color red. Red is a color representing boldness and sexuality, hence the emphasis on this color. The aesthetic also tends to have a grunge-y, unclean look to the objects and style of photography, with lo-fi photography being popular. This represents the spontaneity and care-free personality of the character, and reflects the reality of what an underground musician would experience while performing.
The most featured photographic subject is attractive women who represent this lifestyle.
In line with the hedonistic lifestyle, cigarettes and alcohol are often featured.
Clothes
The cultural perception of a 'Rockstar Girlfriend' is that she is an accessory; something that elevates the status of the male 'Rockstar'. This is an obvious objectification of women.
As the rockstar girlfriend is only a piece of arm candy to her boyfriend, it only makes sense that she embodies the standard ideal of beauty, as this would work to heighten the 'rockstar's' prestige. This is one of the many reasons that this trope (and subsequently, the aesthetic) is flooded with young, white, thin, women.
One of the main ideas that the Rockstar Girlfriend trope depends on is that these women were much different from the rest of the rockstar's groupies; in essence they were 'special'. There was a reason that the rockstar picked them over all the other women they could have [2]. One of these reasons is often that this girlfriend is young. For example, Pricilla Presley was 14 when she met Elvis Presley while he was 24 [4], Prince met 16 year old Mayte Garcia while he was 32 [5], both these men ended up marrying these girls later on. This power imbalance, not only in age but often also in money and fame, leaves the for girls to be groomed and taken advantage of.
Abusive relationships are also glamorized in this trope, as these women are often made to be the 'safe haven' of the suffering artist rockstar. [2]Adding on, the Rockstar trope in of itself glamorizes the use and abuse of drugs and alcohol, which also bleeds into the rockstar girlfriend trope as well.","Flare/bell-bottom pants, leather jackets

Romantic Chinese Village,https://aesthetics.fandom.com/wiki/Romantic_Chinese_Village,"The appreciation of rural living in China has been a common motif throughout history and culture, with the agriculture, material culture, and landscape being admired in literature, poetry, and art.
Romanticized depictions of rural Chinese villages have become incredibly popular, specifically on Douyin, the Chinese equivalent to TikTok. This aesthetic describes the new emphasis on traditional handmade cooking and crafting with farmed or foraged ingredients made with non-industrial tools, filmed along with cinematic shots of the landscape and traditional architecture of China.
This page describes the contemporary trend online, rather than the development and true image of Chinese village life throughout history.
The romanticized image of rural living has been a subject of Chinese art and poetry for centuries, including works by the Seven Sages of the Bamboo Grove (3rd century AD), Tao Yuanming (365-427 AD), etc. These poets wrote about leaving behind diplomatic life and instead leaving to live in the wilderness and like peasants farming for sustenance while admiring nature. Likewise, village scenes, forests, mountains, etc. have been painted by countless Chinese artists.
With social media began the introduction of this theme into an online medium. The popularity of these videos began with Liziqi, a video maker from Sichuan province, who posted her first video in 2015.[1] After her stopping videos in 2021, many other influencers began to fill in the gaps and fit into their own niches, such as depicting specific handicrafts, regions, or recipes.
This aesthetic focuses on rural Chinese villages, which have a particular architectural style. Sloped, tiled roofs, courtyards, intricate wood panels, etc. are in the backgrounds of videos.
Village life also includes the depiction of people in it. In videos, the creator often greets their neighbors or brings food to them. Elderly people often appear in these videos, as Chinese culture emphasizes taking care of the elders and their knowledge of traditions being something to pass down.
These videos often show food being harvested and cooked, with the beginnings as a plant and the end product being a meal eaten by the family. The food is often a regional specialty, for example, with mapo tofu in Sichuan province. Other foods include simple and straightforward foods (i.e. dried sausages) or have associations with Chinese holidays (i.e. large feasts during Chinese New Year).
The creator of the video can also make traditional Chinese furniture, clothing, linens, etc. As with food, the involvement begins with the natural resource, such as a depiction of chopping down wood, harvesting flowers for dye, etc.
However, the aesthetic stays away from the difficult aspects of rural living, with no images of strain in the people depicted, a lack of food, poor infrastructure, etc.","Ancient times, videos in late 2010s",,"Chinese traditions, architecture, food, and nature","Colors that originate from nature

Sadpeople,https://aesthetics.fandom.com/wiki/Sadpeople,"Sadpeople, split by binary gender as Sadgirls and Sadbois, is an aesthetic that originated in Tumblr in the mid-2010s, characterized by black and white edits of anime or cartoons shows from the 80s-90s, cigarettes, trippy imagery, blood, sexuality, Vaporwave-inspired visuals, and references to depression and self-harm. Sadpeople often feel lost either mentally or physically, which is the reason why they revel in the aesthetic's tones. The aesthetic's rise to prominence coincided with the popularization of Emo Rap artists such as XXXTentacion, Lil Peep, and Juice Wrld.
It is somewhat related to Traumacore, but Traumacore deals with physical abuse and abandonment, while Sadpeople is more about depression and mental issues. The Sadpeople aesthetic involves mental space, loneliness, and abandonment.
Unlike Traumacore, the Sadpeople aesthetic tends to focus more on feelings of isolation, loneliness, and anxiety that don't necessarily come from CSA or some form of PTSD and distinctly lacks the child-like nature Traumacore tends to have. However, it can be a popular partner with a Liminal Space aesthetic to show off that loneliness the Sadpeople aesthetic is associated with as well as a sense of dread.
Sadbois don't usually come with a specific style of clothes but they usually dress anywhere from Normcore to Grunge.
Sadgirls don't usually come with a specific style of clothes but they usually dress anywhere from Grunge. There is also an element of the E-Girl aesthetic that can apply to Sadgirls, but the mentality that Sadgirls have makes the fashions hit different compared to their E-Girl counterparts.
Sadenbies, similar to the Sadbois and Sadgirls, usually do not wear a specific kind of fashion and wear something similar to Grunge or Normcore trends usually.

Simpsonwave (or Sadboi Bart) is a meme aesthetic that originated around the mid-2010s, which combines clips and images from The Simpsons with glitch art and Vaporwave visuals. It has many influences from music collectives such as Trash Gang, often featuring songs about heartbreak or social isolation, especially by XXXTentacion.
It is essentially a more childish take on the Sadpeople aesthetic, which possibly originated as a genuine/not ironic aesthetic but later got oversaturated and became a meme.
This aesthetic has been criticized for trivializing depression.
Sadcore is a subgenre of music that is an example of alternative rock characterized by bleak lyrics, downbeat melodies and slower tempos, or alternatively, songs with deceivingly upbeat melodies that are simultaneously characterized by depressive lyrical undertones or imagery.

Sigma,https://aesthetics.fandom.com/wiki/Sigma,"Sigma is an internet meme and character trope that emerged in the late 2010s, based on a hirearchically superior category of the pseudoscientific ""alpha"" and ""beta"" male dichotomy.[1] The so-called ""Sigma Males"" are often portrayed as lone wolves, independent, powerful, solitary, mysterious, self-sufficient, wealthy, superficial, and constantly engaging in self-improvement.
The traits of the Sigma aesthetic are largely drawn from a very niche set of movies and shows, like American Psycho, Better Call Saul, Joker, The Batman, The Wolf of Wall Street, and many other works. The heaviest influences in this movement are Incels, an online subculture focusing on negative dating experiences and misogyny, and more indirectly Yuppies, which referred to American young urban professionals in the 80s (although most followers of the ""Sigma"" movement might not recognize this influence, as they associate it with American Psycho instead).
It is closely related to the concept of hustle culture, a societal mindset that glorifies excessive work and relentless ambition as the sole means to achieve success and self-worth. It promotes the idea that one must constantly be ""on,"" pushing oneself beyond limits, at the expense of personal well-being, relationships, and mental health.
By the early 2020s, it evolved into an actual internet movement and a meme, glorifying several public figures like Andrew Tate, Christian Bale and Elon Musk. However, this movement has been subject to criticism for its controversial aspects, including its ties to the Incel subculture, the glamorization of serial killers, the promotion of misogyny and toxic masculinity, its unrealistic expectations of men based upon works of fiction, and its association with right-wing political ideologies.
The movement is centered around the concept of a ""sigma male"", which is a term used to describe a successful man who is highly independent and self-reliant, often portrayed as a ""lone wolf"". The term is part of a social hierarchy of masculinity, which includes letters of the Greek alphabet like ""alpha"", ""beta"", ""gamma"", ""delta"" and ""omega"", making up the other categories.
The term ""sigma"" used in this context was first recorded in 2010, particularly in a blog written by Vox Day, a controversial author known for his alt-right and white supremacist biases. The second record of the term is The Sigma Male: What Women Really Want, a book published by John T. Alexander in 2014. The term began to expand to YouTube in 2018, when content creators focusing on toxic masculinity began to create video tutorials on ""how to be a sigma male"" or ""how to tell if you're a sigma"".
It recently gained popularity in the early 2020s alongside the rise of Gym Culture on social media platforms like TikTok and Instagram, where the aesthetic is often associated with Drift Phonk music. One of the key aspects is physical fitness, and many people striving to be ""Sigma Males"" attempt to achieve a muscular and toned physique through frequent exercise and strict diets, as they associate that with ""success"" and ""masculinity"".
Andrew Tate is the most well-known figure of the ""Sigma"" movement, and his videos reached infamy for promoting hyper-masculinity and financial success. He posts content showcasing his wealth, like his luxury cars (especially Bugattis) and portraying himself as economically successful. He was criticized because the TikTok algorithm selectively showed his videos to children as young as under the age of thirteen, and some of his videos had misogynistic or propagandistic remarks.
The Sigma aesthetic is commonly parodied and satirized, even by those who actively participate in the communities surrounding it. Characters like Mr. Bean and Paul Blart from Paul Blart: Mall Cop are often called ""sigma"" or ""chad"" due to their ridiculous behaviors, which is often referred to as the ""sigma grindset""; this is in part due to the fact that Sigma Males are sometimes stereotyped as behaving erratically, oblivious to the insanities they revel in due to their sense of masculinity, and their egotistical personality.
By late 2023, the term Sigma had evolved into a satirical husk of its former nature (particularly through ""Gen Alpha Brainrot"" memes). One notable example of the Sigma phenomenon being mocked includes ""Sticking out your Gyatt for the Rizzler""; the song was popularized on TikTok and includes references to Gen Alpha children overusing the word ""sigma"" online with the intention to sound mature. Another popular catchphrase popularized in 2024 is ""erm... what the sigma?"".
The aesthetic associated with the Sigma character trope is defined by the juxtaposition of visuals that evoke power and solitude at the same time, also known as the ""Lone wolf"" trope. It frequently features persons or influencers who have achieved success and wealth, such as Andrew Tate or Elon Musk, or fictional characters known to be rebellious, like Patrick Bateman from American Psycho, Batman, or the Joker.
The color palette seen in Sigma edits is pretty limited and typically includes black, white, various shades of grey, red, and burgundy red, also using color filters, including high contrast, darkness and bold lighting. Accents of deep red, like burgundy, are also very common.
Occasionally, the aesthetic incorporates elements of Corporate culture, like offices, cityscapes, and business attire – this is thought to come from references to the American Psycho film, released in 2000, which was itself heavily based upon a satirical depiction of the American Yuppie subculture.
The Sigma movement is mainly criticized for its unrealistic and unachievable portrayal of masculinity, as these gender roles often rely on works of fiction and not real life. Fictional characters like the Joker and Patrick Bateman from American Psycho are often cited as inspiration for sigmas,[2] mainly because of their charisma and disregard for social norms, but at the same time they are villains and sociopathic individuals and should not be used as role models outside of fiction. American Psycho in particular is a satirical movie,[3] something which many people participating in this aesthetic have missed, and Patrick Bateman's actions are not meant to be taken seriously or imitated in real life. Despite this, many young male TikTok users have been known to attempt to copy his workout routine.[4] Toxic masculinity can also be noted in this stereotype with their focus on being a ""lone wolf"" and isolating yourself in favor of self-improvement or financial success.
The concept of a Sigma is also deeply connected to the Incel ideology. Both groups are more prone to becoming politically radicalized, and ""looksmaxxing"" is a term shared by both communities that originated in Incel forums and later came to be associated with Sigmas as well.[5] It refers to attempting to enhance your physical appareance and beauty to the maximum through various pseudo-scientific methods, like ""mewing"", placing spoons under the eyes, diets, excessive exercise, and even surgery and so much more. This shows that both sigmas and incels have unrealistic expectations of masculinity and self-concept, valuing their appareance but completely ignoring their social behavior or maintaining a positive reputation. Another common trait between both communities is the prevalence of misogyny, as both are more likely to objectify women or believe they are ""inferior"" to men. Sigmas in particular also tend to romanticize the idea of manipulating women.
The admiration of serial killers and mass murderers is another problematic aspect of the ""Sigma"" trope.[6] Various followers of this aesthetic, who may also consider themselves part of the online True Crime community (abbreviated as ""TTC""), have been known to romanticize and idolize notorious killers like Ted Bundy, Richard Ramirez, Adam Lanza, or the Columbine Shooters, sometimes even creating aesthetic edits and videos of their pictures. This type of admiration for criminals, professionally known as hybristophilia, is often based on a fascination with the killer's perceived intelligence and charisma. However, they tend to ignore the fact these persons have commited crimes and murder, trivializing the experiences of the victims as well as any other people, schools and communities personally or emotionally affected by those tragedies.
Sigma propaganda videos are also known to be homophobic, since they tend to portray members of the LGBTQ+ community as ""stupid"", ""weak"", ""effeminate"", or trying to ""push"" their opinions on others. One example would include LionRuler, who got terminated on YouTube for violating the platform's terms of service.
This aesthetic is often accompained with musical genres like Drift Phonk and Hardstyle remixes due to the the association between them and 2020s gym culture. Electronic music with a ""dark"" vibe is also really prevalent. Most songs associated with ""Sigma"" edits are generally popular TikTok audios.",Late 2010s,,"Loneliness, self-improvement, suits, looksmaxxing","Black, white, red",
Silicon Dreams,https://aesthetics.fandom.com/wiki/Silicon_Dreams,"Silicon Dreams, also known as Old CGI or Retro CGI, refers to the surreal and uncanny visuals seen in early CGI animations, art and videogames from the mid-1980s to early-2000s.
Computer-generated imagery (or CGI for short) and its origin can be traced back to the Late 1950s and 60s, when computers were able to render lines and patterns. But the conventional idea of ""CGI"" as we know today wouldn't start until the 1970s, were they started to generate 3D models for the first time. A notable example from the time being ""Computer Animated Hand"" from 1972, which is considered the first 3D computer animation to be ever created.
By the 1980s, CGI began to technologically evolve at a faster rate and slowly being introduced to the mass public through advertisements and TV bumpers. It was also during this time when the common attributes associated with Silicon Dreams start to become a lot more apparent, with demos like Quest (1985), Brilliance (1985), Mental Images (1987), Deja Vu (1987), Polly Gone (1988), and the first Pixar shorts like Luxo Jr. (1986), Tim Toy (1988), and Knick Knack (1989).
During the following decade, the 1990s, CGI starts to get into the mainstream media, with new blockbuster movies and TV shows beginning to adopt these technologies, since it was starting to get more commercially viable then ever before. All of that led to the release of the first CGI feature-length animated film Toy Story in 1995, and Cassiopeia in 1996, which furthered the advancements in CGI that were happening in the 90s.
Despite the leaps in CGI technology between the 80s and 90s, there was a consistent visual identity that was present in 3D animation. It was characterized by sparse landscapes or architecture, low-resolution textures, simple visual effects and objects, environments, and 3D models that are surreal and ""out of this world"" in nature, like something that came out of a dream.
Silicon Dream ended by the Mid-2000s when CGI in animated movies, shows, and advertising became advanced enough and the norm of the industry (i.e. Frutiger Aero). In the 2010s, the aesthetic had a revival on the internet by the rise of aesthetics like Vaporwave and Seapunk, which ended up being used as a tool to complement the visuals of these aesthetics or to create a sense of nostalgia of a bygone time.
Silicon Dreams often includes images, artwork, and shorts made with early CGI from the 80s to 90s, a majority of them being Sci-Fi themed, landscapes or even CGI architecture. A lot of imagery included simplistic polygons, textures, and lighting, due to the technical limitations of the time. It specially includes images made in the computer program Bryce 3D.
The Silicon Dreams aesthetic was also commonly seen in Trapper Keepers of the 90s; loose-leaf binders made by the stationary company Mead that were used for the sake of organizing school supplies for students. This could also be seen as the connecting tissue between it and more modern-ish aesthetics such as Vaporwave, Seapunk, Icepunk, Slimepunk, and Y2K Futurism.
At the time when Silicon Dreams started, many people used computers to generate imagery.
In the 2010s, Silicon Dreams was utilized as an element in Vaporwave music/aesthetics, be it from Oneohtrix Point Never's music video for Nobody Here (which some pinpoint as the very first example of Vaporwave music put out into the wild) as well as the music video for Macintosh Plus's Lisa Frank 420. The Vaporwave connection could be considered a carryover from when the Seapunk community gravitated towards Vaporwave after its decline in popularity, where Seapunk was heavily inspired by many early works within the Silicon Dreams style of aesthetics (due to many members of the community being children at the time Silicon Dreams was first conceived) which added to the sense of nostalgia that both Seapunk and Vaporwave evoke.
Dire Straits - Money For Nothing (Official Music Video)
The music video for Dire Strait's Money for Nothing included early CGI animation in it, as well as Miley Cyrus's music video for We Can't Stop also utilizing clips from the earliest known example of CGI animation (a simple talking face attempting to show emotion and ""talk"" that was made all the way back in 1974). Many Seapunk music videos (specifically from the likes of Ultrademon) utilize a more ""high definition"" variation of the early Silicon Dreams works of the 1990s.
In the late 2010s and 2020s, many Intelligent Drum and Bass/Jungle albums and Low Poly YouTube mixes feature CGI of the Silicon Dreams aesthetic (most notably, the Peshay Studio Set (1996)). Jungle is a more advanced and Y2K Futurism-oriented sound, compared to the more primitive, Late 80s/Early 90s New Age sounds of Vaporwave. Some of the notable Drum and Bass/Jungle artists related to this aesthetic being Inner-Vation, LTJ Bukem, Total Science, and Funky Technicians.
In terms of its usage in early media of the 90s, there was a certain level of what could be described as ""janky"" in this particular era of CGI animation, due to the technology still being extremely new and, as such, still in an extremely primitive state.
Because CGI was fairly new in video games in the '90s, 3D video games have low-poly graphics, meaning that the meshes in games do not have many polygons to create a smoother model.","1970s (first came into prominence in the 1980s)

Slavic Violence Tumblr,https://aesthetics.fandom.com/wiki/Slavic_Violence_Tumblr,"Balkan Violence Tumblr is a theme many Tumblr users used for their aesthetic blogs. In this aesthetic community, people had blogs where they posted and reblogged photos of paramilitary groups from Russia and the Balkans, Russian Orthodox Christian iconography, gore, drugs, weapon collections, and Bondage photos. Many blogs can also include and intersect with photos of the Irish independence movement, WWI and WWII, Middle Eastern terrorist organizations, Soviet Nostalgia, Sacricore, and White Trash aesthetics.

This internet aesthetic later declined because of the Tumblr Purge of late-2018.[1] Because of the aforementioned NSFW elements, many of these blogs were deleted, had their photos removed, and many people left this aspect of social media altogether because of a lack of aesthetic blog-oriented platforms free from bans on violent subjects. However, some aesthetic blogs still remain on Tumblr, albeit with less gore and sex than before the purge.
Most of the images in this aesthetic include young men from Eastern European nations who are in the military, as indicated from their clothing and shaved heads.
Balaclavas are also incredibly common in this aesthetic, with many people, including non-military users, doing photoshoots where they wear these and make intimidating poses.
These photoshoots can also involve women, who are often delicate and blonde, which fits into the Eastern European connotation. These women would be in a sexual situation as submissive towards the male, who would be a person fitting into the aesthetic as per the above description.

So Retro,https://aesthetics.fandom.com/wiki/So_Retro,"So Retro is an ironic phrase referring to a meme aesthetic that largely originated as a result of artists trying to replicate the 8-Bit (sometimes 16-bit) style as an attempt to make their games and/or art look nostalgic, but fail or put no effort into actually doing so. This results in an inaccurate style that doesn't capture the essence of retro games.[1]
Most of the time, it represents low effort, poorly-made pixel art that look kitschy and tacky; so alternatively, this aesthetic can also be called ""Trashy Retro"" or just ""Retrocore"". Anything that can be described as ""So Retro"" may take inspiration from extremely popular games deemed old, such as Super Mario and Sonic the Hedgehog. The aesthetic often includes the MS Paint aesthetic with poorly made drawings in the MS paint program.
The aesthetic may have originated from YouTube user mint301 who created a series titled How to Draw Like a Pro With Paint, which included satirical ""tutorial"" videos on how to poorly copy a sprite from a Retro game in Microsoft paint.
In 2023, the term ""So Retro"" was coined for the aesthetic and gained popularity as a concept within the YouTube animation community[2]. A gif became popular showing sprites from Mario poorly animated, and became associated with So Retro even though it did not incorporate any poorly made pixel art.
The term has been expanded from Pixel Art to refer to games that use the retro Low Poly aesthetic combined with more modern graphical elements which may create an odd feeling, even though this may be an intentional artist choice.",2000s,,"Poorly-made pixel art, inaccurate nostalgic designs","Any 8-Bit colors, usually inaccurate",
Soft Grunge,https://aesthetics.fandom.com/wiki/Soft_Grunge,"Soft Grunge or Pale Grunge is an aesthetic based on simple photos with a color palette primarily consisting of white, grey, black, green, and blue. The aesthetic is believed to have appeared on Tumblr between 2013 and 2015. Some photos are intended to be sad looking, often of someone suffering for love or with a '90s vibe, for example.
Despite calling themselves grunge, followers of the aesthetic were fairly popular in the mainstream and connected to the rise of the Alternative, emo, pop, and indie music and fashion trends of the time, such as galaxy prints, black and white grids, and fandom merchandise. Because of their close-knit community on Tumblr, they developed a ""not-like-other-girls"" attitude, especially in contrast with the ""hipsters"" The type of media they consumed was also incredibly specific, with fangirl culture and this aesthetic often overlapping. This style later declined, yet has gained short-term popularity in 2020 due to a desire to escape to the past.[1]
This aesthetic can be described as very fresh or a clean variation of the grunge style. Enthusiasts of this aesthetic focus on taking pictures that contain:
A basic look
The style associated with 2014-era Tumblr has a very defined color palette in that it is typically monochrome or pastel, depending on personal preference. Japanese fashion, early 2000s emo, and more authentic grunge influenced the style, which has outfits that were incredibly specific, almost formulaic. Unlike grunge or the DIY ethos of other alternative fashions, these pieces were typically bought brand new at mall stores such as American Apparel and Hot Topic. Despite the term ""Tumblr girl"" being the most popular term, men can wear the aesthetic too. Soft grunge outfits are now often associated with bisexual people and LGBT fashion. Typical fashion pieces include:

Soft Macabre photos have creepiness with soft vibes co-existing. Images are given a black and white filter, and then a grainy filter over it. The point of Soft Macabre is to evoke the feelings of sadness and loneliness in what may just be normal or even happy images.

Southern Gothic,https://aesthetics.fandom.com/wiki/Southern_Gothic,"Southern Gothic is a literary genre encompassing fashion inspired by the culture of the American South. It originated in works by 19th-20th century Southern authors criticizing their society's racism, sexism, classism, fixation on the past, and decaying economy.
Later the aesthetic deviated from literature with the ""regional gothic"" trend on tumblr in the mid-2010s, which places greater emphasis on liminal spaces, modern American iconography, evangelicalism, and controversially, hillbilly horror. Because of this, this entry is divided into two sections, with one based on the literary movement and the other on the tumblr revival.
A few movies in the 2000s have gone against the harmful tropes revolving around “evil hillbillies and evangelicals in the South”, such as 2010’s Dale and Tucker Vs Evil. This is still a rarity, though, and is definitely a sociological issue that needs to be better addressed.
This section is under construction
The aesthetic begins in literature which depicts and criticizes the American South. Hence, the general culture of the American South is necessary background. Note that this is not at an academic level and only provides context for the aesthetic.
This culture was a slave-society, where the culture is defined by the practice of slavery, with all its aspects being embedded in politics, economics, popular culture, etc[1]. Therefore, there was often a general exposure to cruel punishments used on slaves, anxieties over slave revolts, and the use of grotesque imagery to dehumanize black people.
Southern societies also emphasized gentility in families, with wealthy families acting somewhat like European nobility, wherein marriages and blood relations were highly important in capital such as owning slaves and a grand estate[2]. Of course, this lends well to the use of incest, decadence, and domestic violence.
Many scholars point to Henry Clay Lewis and Mark Twain as the first to include Gothic tropes in their depiction of the American South.
The Tumblr aesthetic began when Tumblr user user clive-gershwin-palmer in January 2015, created a post that is now deleted.[3] Presumably, it follows the same format as other ""Regional Gothic"" posts, where they write about their regional culture in bullet-pointed prose mimicking Welcome to Nightvale, a podcast wherein a fictional radio host nonchalantly describes cults, Eldritch abominations, and cosmic mysteries in their small town in New Mexico. The trend then picked up in March 2015, with user korvidian created a post entitled ""south-east queensland gothic""[4].
With the popularity of the Regional Gothic trend, people from the American South drew upon bedtime stories, urban legends, and Southern culture in their text posts. The Regional Gothic later developed a visual component, as people uploaded photos of Christian billboards, abandoned churches, and other things in the visuals section. With Southern Gothic in particular, there were many playlists created on the then-popular site 8tracks.com; many creators shared their playlists on tumblr and gained virality.

Spacecore,https://aesthetics.fandom.com/wiki/Spacecore,"Spacecore is an aesthetic that is centered around astronomy, stars and planets. It can also be called Astrocore or Cosmiccore. Spacecore uses lots of stars and celestial imagery/objects such as planets in clothing or decor. Many spacecore aesthetics will have pictures of the sun, the moon, or the stars. Space Cowboy is a subtype of Spacecore.
Spacecore visuals include things such as galaxies, stars, nebulae, planets, moons, and overall pictures of the universe, as well as things like telescopes, space rockets, and traveling along far distances and on foreign planets. Retro-Futurism and Space-Age influences are popular themes in the Spacecore aesthetic. This is a list of popular visuals in the Spacecore aesthetic:
Spacecore fashion incorporates both explicit depictions of space visuals, especially galaxies and local celestial bodies, and less obvious space-inspired style, such as glitter and tulle. Although Spacecore lends itself to formality, it can be integrated into almost any type of clothing, from high fashion to casual to sleepwear. Retro-Futurism is popular in Spacecore fashion. The Galaxy Hipster style of the 2010s may be seen as well, as well as the Harajuku style Uchuu Kei. This is a list of some popular style choices in the Spacecore aesthetic:
Spacecore films mostly consists of futuristic and sci-fi genres. One of the biggest movie franchises Spacecore relates to is the Star Wars series. Thriller and adventure movies also appear in Spacecore (Interstellar & Ad Astra).
Some Chinese cultivation novels, such as Dragon Talisman, Five Frozen Centuries, Low Dimensional Game, Desolate Era, Stellar Transformations, Lord Xue Ying, and the Ergenverse have characters who can manipulate fictional, superpowered stars or black holes and/or can manipulate outer space to create attacks.

Strega,https://aesthetics.fandom.com/wiki/Strega,"Strega is a fashion style and aesthetic centering around the concept of a forest witch. While it always has existed in some form or another as part of the larger Goth subculture, it wasn't until the mid-2010s that it was given an own name that is derived from the latin word for witch ""Stregeria"". As the name suggests, the aesthetic draws inspiration from the existing witch community, particularly those who are also part of the Goth subculture.
Cocteau Twins’ TreasureAll About Eve (self-titled)Christian Death’s Catastrophe BalletTerri Windling’s BorderlandWar For the Oaks by Emma BullJim Henson’s LabyrinthThe Company of Wolves
The Goth subculture always embraced witch-inspired style but also has recently gained recognition outside of the scene. While Strega fashion is influenced by the witch culture, its roots trace back to the dark variant of the Japanese Mori Kei style.
The major purveyor of this in the 80s, both lyrically and visually, was Siouxsie and the Banshees, who moved from grotesque Steven King fare to the more mystical and dream-like in songs like “Spellbound”, “Red Over White”, and “Green Fingers”. (Even going so far as to filming their own version of Alice in Wonderland.)
Meanwhile, Bauhaus wrote the song “Hollow Hills” in reference to Brian Froud and Alan Lee’s Faeries. The album covers and music videos of 4AD’s This Mortal Coil featured ethereal, often forested imagery. Danielle Dax potrayed Wolf Girl in The Company of Wolves, based on Angela Carter’s The Bloody Chamber.
The literary influences came full circle as the fey side of the Goth scene began to influence the fantasy, fairy tale retellings, and urban fantasy of the day. In art, Brian Froud adopted gothic visuals for the movie Labyrinth. In books, Terri Windling’s Borderland anthologies and Emma Bull’s War For the Oaks were overtly a hybrid of fae mythology with proto-Goth imagery.
The influence of this then-nameless movement-within-a-movement has persisted in literary, artistic, and musical works up into the modern era and on social media.
Styles used by certain Strega-type bands helped to originate 90s Hippie Goth and Romantic Goth. But while Hippie Goth is often just boho clothes with dark colors and makeup, Strega tends towards Pre-Raphaelite influences and color schemes as well as the distinctive use of brocade, velvet, and glitter.
The Strega aesthetic tends to feature darkly dream-like, imagery, often similar to Dethereal and Dark Naturalism, such as:
While Strega fashion is similar to Mori Kei in that it features natural, layered clothing, it also adopts a color scheme of black, dark gray, browns, and earth tones, distinguishing itself from the typically off-white hues of Mori Kei. It also may incorporate earthy greens, brick reds, and rich violets while staying true to its Goth roots.
Strega typically incorporates symbolic elements such as pentacles, long dresses, and gender-neutral clothing, reflecting the word's gender neutrality. The style often features loose clothing, reminiscent of medieval forest wear, a nod to the daily activities of witches practicing their magick. With layered garments and high boots, the outfits not only exude a mystical vibe but also offer practical protection. The prevalent use of black in Strega fashion stems from its symbolic association with protection in the witch community. To make the overall appearance more mysterious, mufflers and overcoats are often incorporated into Strega fashion. They not only contribute to the aesthetic but also serve practical purposes, helping in discreet exits from unwanted situations—a seemingly ideal ensemble for introverts—and, of course, providing an extra layer of protection from harm.
Strega also heavily rellies on symbolism associated with witchcraft such as pentagrams, antlers, and crow feathers. There's also many outfits that embrace a bohemian aesthetic inspired by traveling witches. If you aim to create a look based on a specific type of witch that actually exists among practicers in real life it is recommend to do proper research in order to ensure accuracy and alignment with the desired aesthetic.
It has inspired much of 80s era fantasy and urban fantasy, but in general it lends itself to shadowed, ethereal atmospheres. Dark Victorian fairy paintings, jewel tone color schemes, Pre-Raphaelite art, shimmery forests, ballroom/masquerades, and classic ballet/modern dance imagery tend to fit.
These are a few that influenced certain imagery (but were not inspired by this aesthetic, as they predated it).
Bohemian Manifesto: A Field Guide to Living On the Edge by Lauren Stover discusses Fairy Goth, which is extremely similar to Strega.
As this is a Goth subgenre, Goth music and bands are associated, particularly those that explore folkloric subject matter. The vocalists are typically unusual, banshee-esque, and even operatic in their range. It’s also common to see folk rock influences.
Ethereal wave is by far the most dominant Goth genre to find this aesthetic in, particularly from the mid-80s 4AD (and later, Sam Rosenthal’s Projekt) indie record label. Much of the artwork and photographs for the 4AD bands was done by Vaughan Oliver and Nigel Grierson, who created darkly ethereal, abstract album covers and videos. This perfectly mirrors the otherworldly soundscapes of Cocteau Twins and This Mortal Coil.
Albums such as Cocteau Twins' Treasure, Siouxsie and the Banshees' A Kiss in the Dreamhouse, and All About Eve’s self-titled debut are particularly important.
Centered on cosplay and Renaissance festivals. It has been labeled as connected to ethereal wave, but actually has more in common with non-Goth neoclassical darkwave artists such as Priscilla Hernandez and The Changelings. They typically wear full-on dark fairy costumes, complete with wings and dramatic eyeliner, and tend to be fans of the work of Brian and Wendy Froud.
Typically used to describe the styles worn by 4AD 80s ethereal wave bands such as Cocteau Twins and Dead Can Dance. They typically wore long-skirted dresses (either all-black or all-white), pearls, pink eyeshadow, and white tights. They were often surrounded by abstract, dream-like imagery, usually the photos of Nigel Grierson.

Tacticool,https://aesthetics.fandom.com/wiki/Tacticool,"Tacticool, the term being a combination of ""tactical"" and ""cool"", is an aesthetic focusing on military wear and prop replicas of high-end tactical firearms as well as their accessories. It is highly popular within the Airsoft community, and there are also many people who use it as a form of cosplay. There are also many anime style illustrations and games applying the Tacticool aesthetic to the outfits of female characters to make them appear more ""dangerous"" despite their cute appearance.
The negative use of the term originated in a thread on 4Chan's weapons board /k/, where posters use the term to describe superfluous accessories added to weapons. Over the years, the term has started to be used unironically as a positive term by those into that kind of aesthetic.[1]
The aesthetic is generally looked down upon, similar to Mall Ninjas, because they are often internet tough guys who collect weapons and claim being badass and skilled in weaponry, but they do so in a ""cringy"" way and are unable to back up their claims. Many people who are in weaponry communities point out how the quality is not up to par with real military gear and is often impractical if they were to actually use these weapons.
In addition to the products themselves, this community in a sense ""cosplays"" being in the military through making posts on the internet about their ability to fight, hoarding weapons, and enjoying media that is about contemporary warfare, such as the ''Call of Duty'' video game franchise. The aesthetic is also associated with overly militaristic people in the United States, including people who open-carry and/or are involved with conservative/libertarian paramilitary groups.
The weapons that are considered Tacticool may be outfitted with accessories that would not make sense in a real-life context. For example, a scope that is supposed to be for a sniper rifle attached to a handgun, which wouldn’t be able to shoot from long distances.
People in the Tacticool community also have this impracticality in camouflage being a common pattern on a variety of merchandise, such as their shirts, home wares, etc. Like the issue with impractical accessories, enjoyers of Tacticool often wear camouflage in areas where they would not be camouflaged, such as in suburbs.
In line with it's military roots, Tacticool fashion is equally centered around military gear, but it's influence is more on what is worn by special forces units than ""regular"" military. This includes tight-fitting combat shirts and pants, baggy hardshell jackets, plate carrier vests, or low-cut combat shoes.
While Tacticool has been rooted in the military aesthetic, recent trends have shown the Tacticool aesthetic being injected with more paramilitary influences. Key elements to this includes the mixing of ordinary ""civilian"" clothing, most prominently jeans and flannel or plaid shirts; general reduction in camouflage wear or utilizing ""vintage"" camouflage patterns; and usage of non-military issue tactical paraphernalia such as tactical hoodies.
Overseas, prominent variations of the tacticool aesthetic are that of the battle maid and armed schoolgirl, which essentially overlays tactical gear such as vests and kneepads over their respective uniforms. Though, in the latter case it is often with the Japanese style of uniforms.

That Girl,https://aesthetics.fandom.com/wiki/That_Girl,"That Girl is an aesthetic that originated on Tiktok, but later spread to Pinterest and YouTube, mostly in the form of vlogger content. In this aesthetic, women, typically from college-aged to early thirties, show images and videos of being productive and engaging in self-care and self-betterment. They live regimented routines that encourage healthy eating, beauty rituals, fitness, organization, productivity in work and study, and mental healthcare in a clean and simple aesthetic.
The aesthetic is a continuation of many other aesthetics by young women that focus on health, and it has many precursors in marketing, especially in the skincare and fitness industries. The self-help and productivity part of YouTube, where vloggers demonstrate how to be productive and have a routine, is also an inspiration.
It is an aspirational aesthetic and people in the aesthetic are concerned with becoming one's best self in terms of mind, body, and spirituality. This also involves a confident feeling and being kind to others, including gratitude. However, the aesthetic has largely been criticized for being part of the larger trend of toxic productivity and ""hustle culture,"" where people are expected to spend every moment of their lives bettering themselves to a manufactured and unrealistic standard instead of living an authentic life.
The That Girl trend is part of a larger movement in the social media landscape where mental health and self-care has become a concept that people are concerned about.
Visually, the aesthetic bears a lot of resemblance to spa culture. The marketing and ethos of spas share the same ideals of wellness, beauty, and relaxation, with imagery of face masks, spa water, meditation, etc. Likewise, many beauty companies, especially ones that emphasize skincare, have the same emphasis on aspirationally beautiful and clean women. That Girl culture is also a result of the more natural and ""dew-y"" beauty trend and brands that emerged after the Baddie beauty trends of heavy makeup. Glossier is an example. In this trend, the emphasis is on skincare and ""no makeup makeup,"" which That Girls wear, similar to Clean Girls.
The first instance of the term ""That Girl"" is a viral TikTok by the user @angelxadvice in 2021. In it, she dances as a bullet-pointed list of New Year's resolutions showed on screens, with points such as ""eat more fruit and veg"" and ""read more books, trust me."" Later that year, the tag was born.
That Girl is largely based on the ideas of self-improvement, both externally in one's career and relationships, as well as internally with physical and mental health.
You become ""that girl"" in your own way; how someone portrays becoming ""that girl"" will differ greatly from how anyone else portrays it. Becoming ""that girl"" is similar to being healthy, making changes for the better in your life, and constantly challenging yourself to improve. The theme of ""That girl"" is total mental and physical health. You are not required to always eat well-balanced meals and be the fittest female in the world. It's all about improving yourself, and you should do it on your own time and solely for yourself.
Visuals of this aesthetic can include tidy spaces, organized drawers/cabinets, and clean bathrooms. Plastic compartment trays and bins where everything is uniform and in its place has a strong emphasis, especially with skincare and makeup collections. Organizing a space is a popular subject for many YouTube videos and TikToks, as well as cleaning vlogs being popular among this community as well.
Healthy foods are also incredibly common in this aesthetic. Because of the strong emphasis on morning routines in this aesthetic, most of the foods shown are breakfast foods. Fresh fruits and vegetables are featured heavily in foods such as avocado toast, yogurt, salads, granola, peanut butter toast, açai bowls, smoothies, and fruit platters. The latter three are also notable for being colorful and would look pretty in the mostly white posts of That Girl.
In addition to the food is the emphasis on beverages such as spa waters, coffee and matcha green tea. These drinks are often fancier than a plain coffee with milk, such as in the inclusion of milk alternatives, flavorings, cold brew, and foam. Many vlogs show these girls making the drinks themselves or going out to a Starbucks or a local coffee shop as a treat. They also emphasize the importance of routine and labor, as they often make the beverage daily and show the relaxing motion of cutting the fruit, foaming the milk, etc.
Because That Girl is primarily a routine and vlog-oriented aesthetic, visiting different mundane locations is incredibly common. Largely, the gym, neighborhood parks, and grocery stores are often featured in these videos. Exercise at home or at the gym is common.
That Girl fashion is rooted in trendy, basic apparel. White and tan are the most prominent colors in That Girl aesthetic, with green oftentimes appearing as accent color.
Hobbies for this aesthetic are meant to be enjoyable yet productive and good for the person involved.
Music for this aesthetic mainly includes upbeat music and modern R&B artists
This aesthetic is largely criticized for being an example of toxic productivity, which is a mindset where people are overly concerned with work and bettering oneself at an expense of giving up free time and relaxation. Although many of the activities in the aesthetic are deemed relaxing, all of these are pursued for the sake of becoming ""better"" and involve mental labor that does not need to be done for a functioning life. Many people have connected this to corporate culture, where people are encouraged to ""hustle"" for the sake of becoming better employees and leaders.
In addition, the aesthetic is a mode of productivity that has been traditionally pushed on by pop culture that emphasizes routine, habit-formation, being a morning person, and organization. Many people are not suited for regimented routines and are more productive as night owls. In pushing the narrative onto young women that this type of lifestyle equals productivity and is the source of confidence and mental wellness, the people who are not suited for these habits may feel discouraged.
Like many other aspirational aesthetics, people also criticize this aesthetic for being upper-class. The visuals emphasize purchasing items that are incredibly expensive, such as serums and avocados. In addition, there is a lot of emphasis on free time, where the vlogger is able to do the various activities because she is self-employed or not being required to do work that poorer people must do.
However, other people disagree that ""that girl"" has a harmful outlook. Although many people depict it as being all about remaining thin and healthy, that is not the case. When you feel compelled to act in a certain way or to look and act in a certain way, even though the reality is that becoming that girl doesn't look the same for everyone, you have a poisonous attitude. Simply having the desire of improving oneself is enough; you don't need to be striving to be flawless or thinner. Bettering yourself doesn't just mean changing the way you look; it also means improving your internal well-being and increasing your sense of fulfillment, joy, and self-assurance.

TikTok Preppy,https://aesthetics.fandom.com/wiki/TikTok_Preppy,"TikTok Preppy (often simply called ""Preppy"") is an aesthetic that was created around 2021 by Gen Z girls on social media. It shares the same name with the original preppy, which is associated with a New England subculture amongst WASP (White Anglo-Saxon Protestant) families.
This aesthetic is popular on TikTok, Instagram, Pinterest, and online games such as Roblox. It could be described as trendy and cheerful. This style is associated with teens who are in school (often either middle school or high school girls).
Blair Waldorf could never 😭 -2000s -preppy
A comedic short about how Preppy styles changed over the years
Original Preppy came from the way Ivy School upper-class students would dress, which is influenced by the fact that their social circles were tight and the fact that these wealthy families lived in New England and encouraged certain jobs, activities, and mannerisms that indicated their status. Unlike TikTok Preppy, this definition is limited to those of a specific social class.
However, traces of the original meaning of the aesthetic can still be found in this new usage of the term. For example, the use of tennis-inspired clothing can also be seen in the modern interpretation.
The use of the term ""prep"" also had its precedent in the 2000s to denote popular girls, rather than ones in the New England upper class. For example, Cher from Clueless and the Plastics from Mean Girls are characters often cited as preppy despite their lack of academic aspirations. This led to the fashion trends of 2000s Preppy, which is a more casual, sexy, and accessible version of the original Preppy aesthetic.
However, the new Preppy branched out in 2021 with a new look largely based off of certain teen-aged TikTok accounts. In fact, there are TikToks that are centered around Millennials' surprise that there is a new meaning.
Many visuals originate from viral TikTok trends, viral TikTok dances, vlogs, etc.

Too Cool,https://aesthetics.fandom.com/wiki/Too_Cool,"Too Cool (土酷) is a kitschy movement and fashion trend originating from China. Characterized by its bedazzled and ostentatious style, it reclaims rural and traditional Chinese styles that were once considered outdated and unfashionable, transforming them into expressions of individuality and cultural pride. The aesthetic frequently uses vibrant colors, nostalgic imagery, and DIY elements, incorporating motifs of traditional Chinese culture juxtaposed with references to early internet culture and modern, ironic twists.
The aesthetic was pioneered by the Chinese influencer Liu Min, better known by her stage name Princess Butterfly.[1] ""Tu"" (土, literally translated as ""soil"") is one word being used to describe this traditional, rural look. ""Tu"" has mainstream connotations of rural tastelessness and has historically been used to show contempt towards China's rural population. However, its connotations have shifted in recent years, especially on the Chinese internet.[1]
The reclamation of the word ""tu"" is a defining feature of this aesthetic. ""土酷"" sounds like ""too cool"" in English, playfully challenging the stigma against rural culture and transforming a once derogatory term into an expression of empowerment. On platforms like Weibo, young people are actively embracing the term with hashtags like #toocool and #toocoolgirl, garnering millions of views.[1]
To completely understand Too Cool, it's valuable to examine the history of Chinese aesthetics in the global context, particularly how these aesthetics are perceived internationally. These perceptions often fall into two overly simplistic stereotypes: ""the Orient,"" which evokes an image of rich, sophisticated traditional art and culture, while the ""Communist State"" is often reduced to visual clichés associated with authoritarianism and propaganda, derived from Socialist Realism. These stereotypes, perpetuated in Western media and the global art market, contribute to a limited understanding of Chinese aesthetics.[2]
Another prevalent stereotype is the ""Made in China"" label, which is frequently associated with low quality products, knock-offs, and a lack of originality. This stems from China's rapid modernization and urbanization, where the focus on mass production and rapid consumption led to the borrowing and copying of Western consumer aesthetics.[2] While China has become a leading exporter of goods, this has also reinforced the image of Chinese production as synonymous with counterfeiting and a prioritization of profit over creativity,[2] as seen with the Shanzhai aesthetic.
Too Cool reappropiates dismissed elements of Chinese aesthetics and challenges the notion that Chinese production is solely defined by imitation and a lack of originality. It suggests that the act of copying and reinterpreting itself can be a form of creativity,[2] leading to unique and unexpected aesthetic outcomes. This challenges the dominant narrative of Chinese aesthetics as derivative.
It's also important to consider its predecessor, the Shamate subculture.[2] Emerging in the 2000s, Shamate (derived from the English word ""smart"") was characterized by its bold hairstyles and fashion inspired by various Western subcultures like Scene, Goth, Emo, Punk, as well as some influences from Japanese Visual Kei bands.[2] Often perceived as a ""poor rip-off"" of these styles, Shamate nonetheless developed its own distinct identity, particularly among youth in lower-tier cities in China.[2]
The rise of ""Too Cool"" is closely associated with the popularity of Liu Min, known online as Princess Butterfly. Since launching her Princess Butterfly persona in early 2018, Liu Min has become a prominent figure in the Chinese fashion scene. Her personal style, as shown through her presence on platforms like Weibo and Instagram, features a mix of Qipaos embellished with images of Chinese deities, stockings decorated with gold ingots, and photographs set against idyllic backdrops of flowers, clouds, and iconic Chinese landmarks like the Great Wall.[1] Photographer Hu Weishan credits Princess Butterfly as a muse and a source of inspiration, stating that her discovery of Liu Min marked a ""crucial turning point"" in her career, leading to an exploration of kitsch and evolving aesthetics in modern China.[1]
The term ""Too Cool"" is actually a phonetic English translation of the Chinese term ""土酷"" (Tuku), which translates to ""tacky cool.""[2] This references the inherent irony within the aesthetic, as it reclaims and celebrates elements of Chinese culture that were once considered outdated or unsophisticated. According to Yangya, who claims to have created the style, the emphasis should be on the ""Too,"" signifying an excessive or exaggerated coolness, rather than on ""Tu,"" which carries connotations of tackiness.[2]
The controversial Balenciaga ad featuring the Too Cool aesthetic.
While Too Cool has been around since the mid-2010s, the aesthetic entered mainstream consciousness in mid-2020 when Balenciaga incorporated elements of the aesthetic into an advertisement for Qixi, the Chinese equivalent of Saint Valentine's Day.[1] The ad sparked controversy and accusations of cultural appropriation, with many netizens criticizing Balenciaga for utilizing ""vulgar and old-fashioned imagery"" reminiscent of Princess Butterfly's signature style.
Liu Min acknowledged the influence of traditional ""土 earthy"" styles, but she rejects the notion that Too Cool is inherently old-fashioned or something ""of the past.""[1] She views the aesthetic as a form of vintage nostalgia, a retro homage to a period of rapid change and modernization in China. This element of nostalgia is reflected in the DIY aesthetics and references to early internet culture often found in Too Cool imagery, similar to the overseas equivalent of Xpiritualism. The nostalgia of Too Cool is not necessarily about longing for the past,[2] but rather paying homage to bygone eras and a recontextualization of cultural elements that were once dismissed or overlooked.
Too Cool is characterized by embracing elements considered ""tacky"" or outdated, drawing from the fashion and visual culture of rural towns in China. The aesthetic is often expressed through performative photography and videography featuring exaggerated poses, dramatic makeup, and theatrical settings.[3]
Generic picture from the 2018 article ""China Too Cool: Vernacular Innovation and Aesthetic Discontinuity of China"" by Yi Jing Zhou.[2]
The iconography combines elements of traditional Chinese culture and modern influences. It incorporates imagery such as depictions of temples, eagles, and Buddhist figures, alongside references to rural life and older generations, like those found in old posters featuring plum blossoms, lotuses, ancient proverbs, and ""get certificates"" (办证) stickers. This fusion of disparate elements challenges established notions of style and taste. Waterfalls and flowers also frequently appear as a backdrop or setting in photoshoots and videos. Certain typographic fonts combined with a glossy, skeuomorphic texture and rainbow text are also common.
Picture from Princess Butterfly's Instagram.
Too Cool fashion is a combination of contradictory elements, fusing traditional Chinese garments and motifs with modern, often ironic, twists. Qipao, the classic form-fitting Chinese dress, is a staple of the aesthetic, but featuring vibrant colors and unconventional embellishments. For instance, Princess Butterfly has been seen sporting a qipao adorned with images of temples, eagles, and a female Buddha.[4]
Beyond the qipao, the aesthetic incorporates a variety of traditional Chinese garments and accessories, such as bellybands and Chinese tunic suits, often with contemporary adaptations.[4] The juxtaposition of traditional and modern extends to the use of accessories and imagery. Traditional symbols like dragons, tigers, and auspicious proverbs are frequently incorporated into clothing and accessories, often alongside references to early internet culture and contemporary trends.[4] The clashing styles challenge the conventional notions of taste and beauty.
While the term ""Tu"" (土), meaning ""soil,"" has historically been used to denigrate rural fashion as unsophisticated, Too Cool reclaims and celebrates these elements, much like other kitschy aesthetics. Designers and influencers draw inspiration from a range of sources associated with rural life and older generations, including those that predate living memory.[4] Old posters featuring ""well-meaning"" elements like plum blossoms and lotuses, ancient proverbs, and even ""get certificates"" (办证) stickers, which were once a common sight in older residential buildings, are frequently used elements.
The embrace of ""Tu"" aesthetics reflects a growing nostalgia for elements of pre-communist China's past and a rejection of the previously held stigma against rural aesthetics. Reclaiming ""Tu"" can also be seen in the work of designers like Fabric Porn's Zhao Chenxi, who uses humor and tongue-in-cheek references to Chinese cultural symbols from his childhood in his works.[4]
Too Cool has begun to influence mainstream fashion trends in China. Designers like Kate Han of Mukzin and Angel Chen incorporate elements of traditional Chinese imagery and symbolism into their collections, albeit with a more modern interpretation.[4]",2010s,,"Buddhist iconography, traditional Chinese culture, references to internet culture","Vibrant colours, green, blue, teal, pink, red

Traumacore,https://aesthetics.fandom.com/wiki/Traumacore,"Traumacore is a type of aesthetic imagery that delves into the themes of abuse and trauma (particularly sexual trauma or CSA) along with cute visuals to give the whole aesthetic a 'bittersweet tragedy' feel. Mental, emotional, and spiritual abuse are also common themes in traumacore. Traumacore in general tends to be more focused on trauma experienced in childhood, explaining the cute visuals, although adult trauma can also be covered. Many people turn to these images to help them cope with the pain they suffered in the past. Most images for traumacore are ones of Hello Kitty, Dreamcore, Nostalgiacore, or even something like a cake, all overlapped with dark messages.
While many people say traumacore isn't inherently an aesthetic, many of the images used in its photo or video edits are derived from other aesthetics. Traumacore is more of a type of art therapy or visual journaling for many people with trauma. It is worth noting that some people who have went through trauma and use traumacore have stated that traumacore is an aesthetic, (albeit a special kind of aesthetic) while others state that it isn't, since those without trauma may try to romanticize the experiences of traumatized individuals. Whether it's an aesthetic or not, its cultural impact is notable enough to be on this wiki.
It is frowned upon to participate in traumacore if the participant is not a survivor of some kind of trauma themselves, as it is considered fetishization of a very serious issue. Trauma consumes many people's lives. Traumacore can be of use as a coping mechanism for those who need it. However, like any kind of coping mechanism, it should not be a stand-in for proper treatment, like therapy or medication.
Many traumacore edits have negative words or phrases in them (ex: ""I am broken"", ""I will never be clean"", ""you used me"", ""rotten child"", ""please stop"", ""you ruined me""), which reflects on the creator/participant's feelings about themselves and their experiences. Having a way of getting these thoughts out onto a screen or paper can be helpful, as it puts feelings into a visual form that is easier to understand, and also participates as a form of the aesthetic.
The Morute aesthetic is the clearest predecessor of Traumacore, and as the aesthetic declined, Traumacore took over in popularity. Before the advent of naming aesthetics with the suffix -core, Academia, etc. in the early to mid-2010s, the Tumblr community found their aesthetics through combining various tags, such as #creepy, #cute, #vintage, etc., with Morute being a later name. The aesthetic was popular, and even possibly based on, the female music artist Nicole Dollanganger, who is not as emphasized in today's traumacore community.
The morute aesthetic had the same premise of traumacore; users would contrast delicate and sweet imagery with dark subject matter relating to depression, suicide, eating disorders, child sexual abuse, religious abuse, and abusive relationships. However, multiple tropes associated with traumacore today were largely absent. Sanrio edits and Weirdcore imagery did not appear, and there was more explicit material such as gore.
The aesthetic also differed slightly from modern traumacore in that it utilized more medical horror, Southern Gothic, and Victorian imagery such as medical instruments and textbooks, disturbing larvae and butterfly-like monsters, conjoined twins, and daguerreotypes. Horror movie imagery such as Ouija boards, female ghosts, porcelain dolls, and serial killer-dressed men standing ominously was also popular, and the best way to describe the aesthetic at the time was ""victim of a horror movie villain."" A lot of this overlapped with Cult Party Kei, a fashion that spread to America at that time.
Traumacore draws upon a delicate, childlike but implicitly disturbing concept, and aims to blend the unsettling with the innocent. Dolls, angels, bedrooms, and corpses are common motifs used.
There is often a contrast between the imagery and the text in a traumacore visual (for example, one might put a disturbing message under a photo of a porcelain doll or a character from children's media).
Many of those who enjoy traumacore are also fond of the ""rotting aesthetic:"" imagery of bugs, dirt, and mold are often incorporated to represent this theme. It is also common for traumacore aesthetics to reference religious themes (such as crosses, angels, and mentions of Heaven or Hell).
Traumacore aesthetics are generally soft or girlish, though this is not always the case (for example, male followers of traumacore tend to employ more masculine colors and themes).
Many traumacore edits also include nostalgic imagery, as people's trauma happens very often during childhood. Some examples of this are Sanrio characters (like Hello Kitty), children's bedrooms, playgrounds, and other places and things relevant to childhood.
Happycore is the more supportive version of this aesthetic, based more upon coping than combining trauma itself with cuteness.
One of the main arguments against traumacore is its romanticization and aestheticization of mental illness and abuse. In depicting depression, eating disorders, sexual abuse, etc. as beautiful concepts, people who appreciate the aesthetic may seek out these kinds of experiences, which would endanger their health and invalidate the experiences of people who are traumatized and would not want anyone to mimic their experience. For people who have been traumatized, traumacore imagery can cause people to center their identity around these negative emotions and hinder attempts at recovery and developing a personality beyond what they were like while experiencing trauma. Different visuals can also trigger the viewer into past behaviors because of the desire for beauty, such as survivors of eating disorders relapsing after being constantly exposed to images of small and delicate girls.
An issue within the traumacore community is cross-tagging, which is the act of adding non-trauma-related hashtags to traumacore posts. This can be very dangerous, as it allows for people to stumble across triggering posts without deliberately searching for them. (It has been said not to add Sanrio-related tags on traumacore posts because kids and people who are not comfortable with seeing traumacore imagery may be scrolling through these topics.[1]) If you post or repost any traumacore content, please use ONLY traumacore related tags and refrain from using unrelated tags (such as #sanrio, #aesthetic, #pastel, etc.)
Another issue within the community is art theft. This includes reposting edits with no credit, reposting edits with improper credit (writing simply ""credits to the artist/creator""), claiming others' works as one's own, or reposting/using others' work in edits without permission. When reposting traumacore edits/art, first make sure the original artist allows reposts, then clearly type their username in the post description. This allows people to know who made an edit every time it gets reposted. Related: if you know the creator(s) of any of the images in our gallery, please comment and let us know!

Trxsh,https://aesthetics.fandom.com/wiki/Trxsh,"Trxsh (or simply Trash) is an aesthetic and internet subculture that is heavily inspired by the Trash Gang collective. Aesthetically, it often incorporates the sharp smiley face mask, references to devils, dark streetwear, and influences from urban culture and Japanese anime. It encompasses fashion, music, editing, and design.
Trash Gang was initially a project started in Slovenia in 2017,[1] but quickly expanded into an international alt internet movement. It has notably influenced various internet aesthetics, including underground rap, modern skater culture, E-Boys and E-Girls, Sadpeople, and some subgenres of Vaporwave such as ""Simpsonwave.""
Trash Gang was originally founded as a project in Ljubljana, Slovenia, around the summer of 2016. The collective established itself on YouTube, where it began uploading music videos. Trash Gang positioned itself as an open ""cyber gang,"" which means they invite anyone from all over the world to join their online subculture. Their early videos began being uploaded in January 2017, and included aesthetic music videos drawing inspiration from a wide range of sources (such as Cloud Rap music, Vaporwave, Simpsonwave, Sadbois and Sadgirls, modern Grunge, Skater culture, anime, etc.) Their take on the alt/underground aesthetic began to expand on YouTube and other platforms such as Roblox really quickly. By 2018, they began uploading AMVs of songs by notable rappers - such as XXXTentacion, $uicideboy$, Lil Peep, or Ghostemane - and also actively collaborated with their fanbase. Naruto and Tokyo Ghoul were particularly popular in the fanbase.
Trxsh began to fade out as a genuine aesthetic community in 2021 due to the increasing commercialization of the style. Once dedicated to promote underground artists, it now primarily charges fans in order to get their music in the channel. The quality of the AMVs posted in the official YouTube channel has also considerable declined, with most of the recent videos being aesthetically carbon copies of each other.
The Trxsh aesthetic incorporates elements of e-boy, hip-hop, and trap metal culture, particularly through the use of dark clothing, chains, and tattoos. Followers of the aesthetic sometimes draw inspiration from modern grunge and skater culture as well. Anime is an important element of the aesthetic, with anime edits and AMVs (anime music videos) serving as popular mediums for visual expression. In these edits, characters from anime shows such as My Hero Academia or Western animation (like The Simpsons) are edited to look like stereotypical bad boys, with black tattoos, a black-white-red color palette, and gold chains. Many members of Trxsh (as an online subculture rather than a trademark) incorporate imagery from shows like Tokyo Ghoul and Naruto into their online profiles and edits. Recurring motifs include black silhouettes adorned with devil horns and the Trash Gang mask (which loosely resembles a shark's teeth) and the use of yellow and black hazard symbols.
The Trxsh, Simpsonwave, and Sadpeople aesthetics peaked around 2018-2020. During these years, all of them faced criticism for potentially romanticizing depression or portraying it as ""cool."" This concern stemmed from the frequent use of imagery and music associated with topics of sadness, depression, heartbreak, and isolation. Some argued this allowed for emotional expression, but others worried it could normalize or minimize the seriousness of mental health struggles, especially for teenagers.
The use of the Kanji alphabet out of context could also be interpreted as cultural appropriation.
Beginning in 2021, Trash Gang has been criticized for ""selling out"" (i.e., shifting towards commercialization). They began charging artists for placement in their AMVs, usually for very high prices ranging from 300€ to 600€. This is while more estabilished rappers can get free features in the videos if they are notable enough or friends with Trash Gang managers,[2] which is unfair. The community became concerned that the official YouTube channel is prioritizing profit over artistic merit and the sense of community that made it successful in the first place. Their recent music selection became less unique and more bland, following TikTok trends instead of promoting underground artists, some of which even reported being rejected despite their talents. The recent AMVs have also been criticized for being recycled and not innovative, with a trendy style remarkably inspired by Jujutsu Kaisen. This has led to the decline of Trxsh as an aesthetic.",2010s,,"Devil horns, sharp smiley, anime","Black, white, red, yellow",
Vanilla Girl,https://aesthetics.fandom.com/wiki/Vanilla_Girl,"The ""Vanilla Girl"" aesthetic that emerged in the early 2020s and gained significant traction on social media platforms like TikTok, Instagram, and YouTube. It is a visual and lifestyle aesthetic characterized by simplicity, nostalgia, gentle femininity, mindfulness and self-care. The aesthetic is inspired by the Clean Girl and Soft Girl aesthetics, which revolves around wearing predominantly white and cream colors and shades. The trend uses wardrobe essentials in a neutral-colored palette and barely-there makeup to achieve a natural, yet stylized, minimalistic appearance.
The ""Vanilla Girl"" aesthetic has faced some criticism for enforcing stereotypes of traditional gender norms, lacking diversity and promoting a homogenous, narrow beauty standard, being materialistic and consumerist, having unattainable standards of beauty and lifestyle and lacking authenticity for promoting a very filtered and curated version of reality.",2020s,,,"White, brown, beige cream
",
Vaporwave,https://aesthetics.fandom.com/wiki/Vaporwave,"Vaporwave is a retrofuturist aesthetic and music genre that branched off from Hypnagogic Pop in the early 2010s. Characterized by its nostalgic and surreal atmosphere, Vaporwave blends electronic music with chopped and screwed and samples, while also featuring a distinct visual style that pays homage to bygone eras of popular culture (typically the Memphis Design, Y2K Futurism, and more recently Frutiger Aero eras). Vaporwave overlaps with and is often confused for Synthwave, a related aesthetic/music genre which often features heavier beats and draws more exclusively on 1980s culture (with Vaporwave drawing from not just the 1980s but also 1990s and 2000s).
Vaporwave has been interpreted by many as being a criticism/parody of corporate aesthetics and capitalism,[1] though others disagree and instead see it as a celebration of these aesthetics.[2] The genre is not merely a musical experience but rather a cultural commentary on the rapid pace of technological advancement and the commodification of the past.
The genre emerged in 2011 from online communities, such as Turntable.fm. In subsequent years, it gained popularity through websites such as Bandcamp, Soundcloud, Tumblr, Last.fm, 4chan, and YouTube. Its rise in popularity coincided with the decline of Seapunk and while the two certainly share similar aesthetic choices, there is a distinct difference between the two.
The key difference between Seapunk and Vaporwave is that Seapunk had a much more focused aesthetic on early '90s CG images and aquatic life. On the other hand, Vaporwave cast a broader net on its aesthetic cues, choosing to highlight the period from the 1970s to early 2000s (crossing over somewhat with the Y2K Futurism aesthetics of 1997—2004). It is debated when the period that Vaporwave is centered around ended; some mark the September 11, 2001 terrorist attacks as the ending point, while others mark the Great Recession of 2008 as the end point. Since 2022, Frutiger Aero aesthetics of 2004—2013 have started to make their way into the Vaporwave scene, which would make the cutoff point 2010—2013 when smartphones and Flat Design became fully popular and social media took a different turn.
DEAD MALL SERIES - The Vulnerable Marley Station Mall (Ft. Music by S U R F I N G from DEEP FANTASY)
One of the big early inspirations for the Vaporwave visual aesthetic draws direct inspiration from the Memphis Group, a name given to a group of post-modern designers and architects, founded in Milan, Italy by Ettore Sottsass in 1980. The original group disbanded in 1987, but their influence lived on, and Memphis Design peaked in popularity from the late 1980s to early 1990s. By the mid-late 1990s however, it had become seen as a tacky product, and its popularity faded. In the late 2000s/early 2010s, Memphis began to gain appreciation from designers, collectors, and many of those with nostalgia and fond memories of the '80s/early '90s.
The bright colors and simple shapes would later inspire media and products aimed at children and youth of the era, in aesthetics such as Memphis Jr. and Factory Pomo. Examples included Nickelodeon, MTV, Pee Wee's Playhouse, Discovery Zone, Gymboree, Trapper Keepers, toys, and many other staples of Kidcore, which given the time period it was popular in, makes it perfect to fit in with the Vaporwave aesthetic, since many early members of the Vaporwave community were kids during the time the Memphis style was popular.
Vaporwave has garnered some significant attention from the music press as of late. Most recently, artists such as Vektroid, HKE, Infinity Frequencies, The 2814 Proyect and R23X have gotten covered by music sites and blogs such as The Guardian, Dummy, Fader, FACT, The Wire, Thump (Vice), Red Bull Music Academy, The Quietus, Resident Advisor, TinyMixTapes, Marcel's Music Journal, Cokemachineglow, The Needle Drop, and others. Coincidentally, several Vaporwave zines have started popping up, the most notable of them being Private Suite Magazine.
Popular visuals utilized in Vaporwave aesthetics can include, but are not limited, to Anime and cartoons, (often from the '70s to '90s but not always, ie. Sailor Moon, Neon Genesis Evangelion, and even The Simpsons, as popularized by artist Lucian Hughes), drug use (almost always in the form of codeine syrup or lean, or pills), Classical sculptures such as the Apollo Belvedere and Laocoon, Consumerism (often displays brand names and logos, such as Adidas, Pepsi Cola, Microsoft Windows, Macintosh Plus, PlayStation, Arizona Iced Tea, and Fiji Water), computer hardware and graphics from the '80s-early '00s (The Windows 95 operating system is used often in vaporwave artwork and edits, as are images of early computers such as the first of Apple's Macintosh PCs), city skylines, malls, sadness or distress (often employed to emphasize the ironic soullessness of the Vaporwave aesthetic, in a 'sad but aesthetically pleasing' kind of way), Liminal spaces (while on a creepier level, the surreal and nostalgic feeling goes quite well with this aesthetic), grids/lines/shapes (the inclusion of this in particular has led to some confusion with Synthwave aesthetics), pink and teal, altered reality (pictures with unnatural hues and tones can be seen throughout this aesthetic. Heavily edited pictures of the world around you can soon become unrecognizable and foreign), glitches, and the gratuitous use of Japanese, Korean and Chinese characters. Japanese seems to be one of the most used languages in the vaporwave community's artwork. Full width versions of Latin characters, used in Japanese, Korean and Chinese computers, are also commonly seen in the aesthetic.
There is an air of ambiguity of whether Vaporwave artists are either celebrating the rampant capitalism that birthed the Vaporwave aesthetics, ironically mocking the hollowness of a lot of these visual cues which mistakes shallowness for depth, or just happens to think they look or sound cool/nostalgic. It is generally left up to the listener as to what they think the artist meant with the final work.
Most Vaporwave entertainment seems to be relegated to YouTube series (although that doesn't stop a lot of major corporations to, ironically, co-opt a lot of Vaporwave aesthetics for their marketing campaigns), with series such as Dan Bell's Dead Mall Series and Retail Archeology being prime examples of cataloging what Vaporwave is all about, while SkyCorp Home Video takes the Vaporwave aesthetic and becomes a major pastiche of early '90s entertainment and commercials. The films Spider-Man: Into The Spider Verse, Valerian City of a Thousand Planets, and The Wave use the vaporwave aesthetic within their respective worlds and for stylistic and creative narrative.
Influential game for the vaporwave community, Ecco the Dolphin
Vaporwave, unsurprisingly, also has a rather strong and thriving presence in video games. Although it's primarily in the independent game space, the two best-known examples of Vaporwave video games are Broken Reality and Mall Quest. Although one can find many examples of Vaporwave gaming on GameJolt to play for free (which is fitting for the general tone Vaporwave goes for).
Vaporwave also prominently co-opts video games within the aesthetic as well, as the video game industry was becoming increasingly profitable at the time vaporwave is based around, so the aesthetic often incorporates video games from the time, including the NES, GB, SNES, PS1, GBC, Dreamcast, GBA and occasionally Atari devices.
A game frequently referenced in vaporwave is the game Ecco the Dolphin, as well as it's sequels, even inspiring one of the founding albums of the genre, Chuck Person's EccoJams, as well as the song ECCOと悪寒ダイビング by Macintosh Plus, from the famous vaporwave album Floral Shoppe. The music of the game is popular among fans of vaporwave for it's trippy feel and all around vaporwave vibes, and the game is one of the reasons why dolphins are so prevalent in vaporwave imagery.
現代のコンピュー (Music Video)
Vaporwave originally started as an offshoot of the genre hypnagogic pop, which was what the founding artists of the genre, such as Daniel Lopatin, Vektroid and James Ferraro were labelled as at the time. The genre was first characterized by its heavy use of samples from the 1980s and 1990s music, typically pop, smooth jazz, or Muzak. Samples are often pitched down, layered, or altered in classic chopped and screwed style. However, vaporwave has started to incorporate more original compositions in a range of directions, from the happy, and faster paced sounds of artists such as Surfing and George Clanton to the more distorted and surreal sounds of artists such as 2 8 1 4 and Nmesh. Artists have also started to get creative with the physical mediums they sell their albums on, ranging from the conventional (vinyl and cassette) to the unusual (Minidiscs, floppy discs and even Game Boy Advanced cartridges). There are so many Vaporwave Music Artists out there that we won't be able to exactly list them off, but we can give you a list of some Vaporwave artists that can serve as an introduction to the genre.
Some of these artists include:
Due to a lot of similar aesthetic cues, most notably neon grids, palm trees and the famous sunset, to the untrained eye, it's easy to confuse the aesthetics of both Synthwave and Vaporwave (and some people have tried to make politically motivated edits that do, indeed, confuse the two aesthetics and assume they are the same). Let it be known; they are, indeed, two completely separate aesthetics with two completely different goals in mind. While Vaporwave is more political, satirically using consumerist media, including advertisements, products, shopping malls and brand logos, as well as presenting its nostalgia in a way that feels more dreamy or trippy, using faded pastel colours and glitched visuals. It also celebrates the expansion of civilisation, often showing computer graphics of the time, and most notably using Japanese visuals, including anime, Japanese text and Japanese music, as Japan was at the forefront of the expansion at the time, experiencing an economic miracle and producing all kinds of technology that was shipped all across the world.
Synthwave is more of a genuinely earnest celebration of television, music and video games from the 80's, sometimes mimicking the bad plot lines and awesome visuals, and has a more dramatic colour palette, featuring vibrant neon colours (excluding green) in contrast with dark blues and blacks. This confusion is also not helped due to the fact there have been several instances of Synthwave and Vaporwave artists collaborating on projects and some artists coming in-between the two genres, such as Home and Hotel Pools.
In short, Synthwave concentrates on fast-tempo electronic music inspired by the emerging synth scene in the 80's, while Vaporwave concentrates on the ironic use of consumerist media and mass-produced and artificial pop music, but also celebrates nostalgia from the 80s and 90s.
Since the music genre was born, Vaporwave has expanded into multiple directions, making it hard for newcomers to fully understand how it is defined. Below, you will find a list of the more well-known subgenres of Vaporwave to help understanding the common traits and differences between them.
ＴＨＥ ＡＲＴ ＯＦ ＶＡＰＯＲＮＯＩＳＥ 従来の蒸気騒音
Within Vaporwave, Broken Transmission stands out as one of the most distinct styles. The music incorporates samples of television commercials, radio jingles, and dialogue clips, and blends them with the typical Vaporwave sound while chopping them up in an erratic manner to evoke the impression of a disrupted transmission.
Chuck Person's Eccojams Vol 1. Visual Album
Eccojam is a piece of music usually made from a single short loop of the source material. It is nearly always from the seventies, eighties, or nineties and smothered with effects, most notably reverb and echo. Made popular by Daniel Lopatin (under his Chuck Person alias), many points to this being the very beginning of Vaporwave as we know it, due to a lot of the hallmarks of modern Vaporwave popping up in the Eccojams sound.
Subgenre of Vaporwave, which takes elements from another subgenre such as Utopian Virtual created from James Ferraro's album Far Side Virtual, but instead of presenting a retrofuturistic utopia, it presents a much darker and surreal version of this utopia. Still, it is much more optimistic and less ironic than the original Vaporwave. As of the 2020s, it is considered a response to its parent subgenre.
Main article: Future Funk
Future Funk is one of, if not the largest subgenres of Vaporwave, partially splitting off into its own aesthetic, using Vaporwave-style sampling in its music, and particularly concentrating on Vaporwave's use of Japanese media of the time. While the subgenre originally focused on the funk scene, with the original album of the scene being Saint Pepsi's Hit Vibes, which was almost entirely built upon 80's funk and disco sampling and modern EDM drums and audio effects, the scene took a turn towards sampling Japanese city pop and anime music and a majority of its imagery being taken from vintage anime, usually set in an urban environment, thanks to the musicians Macross 82-99 and Yung Bae.
Similar to Mallsoft, Future Visions turn the futuristic atmosphere of Vaporwave into a real experience. The ""vision"" is taken literal, as future visions stands out as one of the more visual expressions within the Vaporwave genre. Different to other subgenres, it heavily relies on ambient textures, resulting in a fusion of hypnagogic drift and utopian styles. With a predominant use of synthesizers and dreamy elements, Future Visions is distinctly characterized by its dominant Cyberpunk themes.
Hypnagogic Drift, among the earliest manifestations of Vaporwave, possesses a more dream-like atmosphere compared to other subgenres. It created a drifting feeling by using unconventional samples and sometimes borders on the verge of ambient music. 骨架的 stood out as one of the first artists to create music in this style, but the genre has since continued to evolve. Notably, this subgenre is recognized for its frequent use of weird visuals, aiding the surreal atmosphere of the music.
Late Night Lo-Fi adopts the practice of sampling from Eccojams and draws inspiration from the 90's retrofuturism found in utopian styles. However, it's very different from it by presenting these influences in a new, apolitical light. This subgenre is primarily focused on evoking the atmosphere of vibrant city nights, infused with a blue feeling. It achieves this by heavily sampling 80's music and smooth jazz, creating a sound that captures the essence of bright lights and the allure of big city evenings.
Main article: Mallsoft
Similar to Faux-Utopian, Mallsoft utilizes the concept of ""virtual plaza"" that is commonly associated with Vaporwave. Its sound is characterized by reverbs and a washed-out quality, creating a dream-like atmosphere that is supposed to emulate the sensation of strolling through a virtual plaza. Additionally, mallsoft shares the concept of a hypercapitalist dream world (or nightmare), connecting it with utopian virtual and faux-utopian genres.
One of the first subgenres of Vaporwave, Utopian Virtual is mostly inspired by Jame's Ferraro's 2011 album Far Side Virtual, which used intentionally artificial sounds, such as midi pianos, simple drum patterns and synthesizers, calling to mind a plastic utopian world of the Sims and fashion magazines of the late 20th century. Much of its imagery is inspired by the simple and too-clean textures seen in late 90's and early 00's 3D video games.
A satirical genre that criticizes the over-aestheticization of the Vaporwave and also takes the misconception that the typical music is ""easy"" to produce, literal. There's many releases of this type and many people confuse them for real Vaporwave due to their sheer amount. Examples are Dream by bl00dwave and Subliminal Romance Part II by WΔll Flowers.
Vaportrap is a type of Vaporwave that incorporates drum beats from trap. The characteristic trap drums include hi-hats with varying note subdivisions, typically between 8th notes, 8th note triplets, 16th notes, and 16th note triplets. Other common characteristics are 808 bass, and medium or slow tempos. Blank Banshee is an example of Vaportrap.
VHS Pop is one of the most popular Vaporwave subgenres, being home to some of the most influential Vaporwave musicians, such as Luxury Elite, Surfing, Eyeliner and George Clanton. It generally mimics or samples pop music from the 80's and 90's, though often uses vocal effects and reverb to give the genre the iconic dreamy nostalgia of Vaporwave; though, is still considered one of the more lucid subgenres of Vaporwave.
Subgenres that are less prominent inside the Vaporwave community or focus more on a visual theme rather than an unique sound are listed below:
Vaporgoth ホログラフィック ゴシック (Hologoth)
Deathdream (or Vaporgoth) is a subgenre of vaporwave that draws inspiration from the dissonant, dense, gloomy and oppressive atmospheres of genres like black ambient and drone, is characterized by its simple and obscure use of samples. The genre was started by several unrelated vaporwave artists, such as father2006, Chinese Hackers, The Darkest Future, etc.
Aesthetically, the genre is presented in a distorted and dark style, where a lot of death symbolism is used, which is highly reflected in the narrative of the genre's songs and albums.
The genre is easily recognizable by the usage of dark ambient synthesizers (low octave droning synthesizers, chorus synthesizers), dark and heavily atonal sounds, reverb, a more minimalistic sample editing (as opposed to the more traditional vaporwave), lo-fi, slow, creepy production, and other techniques used to create a dark mood. The songs are usually either very short or very long, but always unstructured and ""illogical"", the tracks are sometimes no longer than two minutes or can be more than 10 minutes long (as in the case of the album White Death by father2006). Chopping, chorus, reverb, delay and other basic elements of Vaporwave production are still used, but they are more infrequent.
Main article: Doomer
An example of Doomerwave.
Doomerwave is described as a microgenre that combines Vaporwave with Post-Punk, Post-Rock and Chopped 'n' Screwed music, as these musical genres are stereotypically associated with the Doomer subculture online. Doomerwave tracks often consist of samples of songs belonging to these genres. They are slowed down both in speed and pitch, and melancholic elements are added, like record cackles, glitch sound effects and high reverb. Multiple Doomerwave songs, tracks and remixes can be found on YouTube and Reddit, where they gained a cult following.
Main article: Sadpeople
Simpsonwave (or Sadboi Bart) is a meme aesthetic that originated around the mid-2010s, which combines clips and images from The Simpsons with glitch art and Vaporwave visuals. It has many influences from music collectives such as Trash Gang, often featuring songs about heartbreak or social isolation, especially by XXXTentacion.
A Guide to Dreampunk music by u/LIFE2979 on Reddit.
Not to be confused with Dream Punk, Dreampunk was largely born from the vision of 2814 (the collaboration between HKE and t e l e p a t h テレパシー能力) which was initially a more ambient take on Vaporwave music that relied less on samples and more on original instrumentation, while embracing the Cyberpunk elements that Vaporwave played with more upfront. Since then, however, Dreampunk has started to drift away from its Vaporwave roots and evolve into its own unique aesthetic.
Gamewave is a very vague term, which would encompass several Vaporwave microgenres centered around video games. Especially, video games from the period between the 80s and the 2000s. Some notorious examples are :
5 MOST INFLUENTIAL HARDVAPOUR ALBUMS
Hardvapour is an Internet-based microgenre that emerged in late 2015 as a tongue-in-cheek response to Vaporwave, departing from the calm, muzak-sampling capitalist utopia concept of the latter, in favor of a Gabber and Punk-influenced sound.
It has, in recent years, however, gotten some controversy and flak due to a lot of the artists within the genre saying and doing things that are just blatantly done for the sake of offending people and starting to border into Fashwave territory - so it has largely been disowned by the Vaporwave community as a whole, much like other offensive subgenres.
The Mysterious Genre Known As ""Signalwave""
Signalwave is the in-formal name for Vaporwave that is primarily focused on old media sampling, particularly from television ads and the like. Although this has been taken in many different directions (the cassette release of Laserdisc Visions adopted this approach), there are typically these unifying characteristics to these ""broken transmissions"". Some of these include sample-heavy, dated media aesthetics, and mild musical inclinations. These releases also may incorporate smooth jazz into themselves to invoke the garbage muzak aesthetic that Vaporwave is built upon. Some of the most prominent artists in this subgenre are bl00dwave and nmesh.
Slushwave is a subgenre of Vaporwave that encompasses the sound of “t e l e p a t h テレパシー能力者“: heavily layered tracks that are often longer than normal Vaporwave (typically longer than six minutes), obscured under ping-ponging sampling and significant reverb.
An example of Spainwave mimicking the iconic Macintosh Plus cover.
Another example of Spainwave centered around the city of Seville and with clear Synthwave influences.
Spainwave is a subgenre of Vaporwave, originating from the subreddit of the same name, with many influences from other subgenres such as Vapormeme, or Laborwave and Fashwave (in the sense that there are works heavily influenced by Synthwave aesthetics), which deals with themes or cultural references from the Iberian Peninsula (especially Spain and its regional cultures) and imagery from the Spanish Golden Age as well as modern Spanish content. Although not limited to the 80s, it covers more periods from approximately the 60s to the 2020s. With a special emphasis on the 2000s and 2010s, it could also be considered a subgenre of Tenwave or at least a meeting point between the two aesthetics. Despite being a genre with many years of existence behind it, it was not until the 2020s that it entered the music category with a song titled Ｒａｊｏｙｗａｖｅ, named after politician Mariano Rajoy.
Vaporfunk is a subgenre of Future Funk. Typically, Vaporfunk has slightly less energy, and tempo than Future Funk, but still uses upbeat rhythms. Typical characteristics are funky bass lines, upbeat drums, horns, and disco/funk guitar riffs. Vaporfunk is often used to described ""chill"" Future Funk. Some examples are:
Vaporwave has been accused of appropriating and commodifying elements of various cultures, particularly from East Asia. This includes borrowing imagery from Japanese pop culture, incorporating kanji characters without fully understanding or respecting their meaning, and treating cultural artifacts as mere visual tropes. Due to its high potential for becoming formulaic and lack of any accompanying real-world contexts, it could be said that this applies to all content vaporwave samples, regardless of origins, including Western cultures, Latin cultures, and even propagandist variants when in context to a seeming lack of any input from modern nations who may no longer follow or approve of the past actions being promoted by such subgenres.
Additionally, even ""low-brow"" culture such as advertisements are often misinterpreted as having been popular or well-remembered, despite such famous vaporwave samples as ""Mac Tonight"" (from a late 1980s commercial for 24/7 McDonalds) having always been obscure among the general populace; if cultural appropriation can be extended temporally, it can be argued that vaporwave has contributed to a muddied and inaccurate perception of worryingly recent historical events.
Vaporwave's tendency to rely on recurring motifs and visual clichés, such as palm trees, statues, Greek columns, and VHS artifacts, can be seen as formulaic and repetitive. Critics argue that this can result in a lack of innovation and originality, with many vaporwave works appearing similar or derivative.",2010s,,"Drug use and distorted/dream-like imagery, Japanese language, culture and media, antiquated 3D graphics and retro technology, Hellenic statues and pillars, dolphins, beaches and exotic foliage, brands, luxurious lifestyles, mass consumerism and Memphis design

Waif,https://aesthetics.fandom.com/wiki/Waif,"Waif, also known as Girlblogger, Femcel, and Female Manipulator, is a type of Coquette blogger who posts content relating to rich, beautiful, intelligent, self-destructive, and manipulative teenage to twenties-aged girls, wherein the imagery reflects the lifestyle that such a young woman would have. Largely, ""nepotism girls"" (female celebrities who got to their fame via nepotism), models, ballet dancers, and boarding school students are examples of these types of characters.
Arguably, it can be seen as a continuation of Heroin Chic, and it was influenced by Dark Nymphet, the Tumblr Sad Girl, the Pro-Ana/thinspo community, literature with unlikeable protagonists, and the humor of the podcast The Red Scare. In addition to aesthetic images, much of this information comes from memes, Whisper confessions, and text posts of things happening within their personal lives.
What distinguishes this aesthetic from the previous aesthetics above is the persona of these bloggers. Rather than portraying themselves as delicate and broken, they put on a confidence and rudeness that shows independence and openness. Specifically, the memes and text posts produced have a flippant or egocentric tone. However, these girls are using it as an expression of their mental illness, and often it is implied that the narcissism is a show to hide deep insecurity. In addition to the glamour of independent and precocious lives of parties, money, and influence, there are multiple references to drug use, depression, daddy issues, eating disorders, and the desire to gain male attention from their looks.
Other aesthetics with similar visuals but less controversial values include Dark Coquette, Dollette, and Coquette in general.
Past aesthetics that influenced this aesthetic include Heroin Chic, 2000s fashion culture(see McBling), Nymphet, and Soft Grunge.
The visual motifs and philosophy in this aesthetic are largely a result of individual trends from 2020 that when combined, form the Waif aesthetic. To be specific, being skinny is becoming back in trend[1], Balletcore and Coquette have their basis in runway fashion, and Catholicism is known to be edgy among Gen Z[2]. There is also a changing perspective on literature on social media where the identity of being a ""reader"" makes one attractive[3]. In addition, the rise of ""girl internet,""[4] where young women identify with and label all of their habits as something related to ""girls,"" is also extremely influential, with Waif being both a result and a propellent of the trend. The Pink Pilates Princess trend is closely related to Waif, as it focuses on femininity as well as diets and working out.
This aesthetic first appeared circa 2020 on Pinterest, Tumblr, and the Whisper app. It later spread onto Instagram, which largely reposts content from the latter two social media sites.
On Tumblr, these photos are proliferated through mass-tagging, some of which include the names of authors considered part of this community's canon and their books, ballet, Lana Del Rey, Lizzy Grant (Lana's former stage name), Lilly Rose Depp, Heroin Chic, etc.
As the aesthetic grew, a magazine run by a girlblogger, which contains the writings of other people in the online community, came to be; it is named Delude Magazine.
In July 2024, CharliXCX released the album brat, which includes the song ""Mean Girls."" This describes the character of a girlblogger/waif, specifically Dasha Nekrasova[5], making this aesthetic subculture more widely known to music listeners and the internet.
Note: Because the claims may be interpreted as harsh, there is a gallery with image evidence supporting the claims made here. The evidence is image-based because of the format being largely Whisper.
This aesthetic community largely preoccupies itself with femininity, specifically in the experiences, joys, and tragedies of being a feminine teenager, likely white and middle to upper-middle class. Texts often vent about the difficulties of teenagehood, with the accompanying expectations, insecurities, and uncertainties in the personality traits, romantic life, sexuality, academic/professional habits, etc. that a girl should inhabit. Despite this, many posts also celebrate the joys of girlhood, such as the fun that accompanies fashion, comraderie with other women, etc.
Appearance is one of the most primary discussions in this aesthetic; the girls who participate in this aesthetic have a preoccupation with becoming beautiful through becoming skinnier, having attractive clothing, and projecting an attitude resembling a desirable and confident person. One reason for this is that they recognize the social rewards for being so. The aesthetic's alternate name, ""female manipulator,"" proves this, and through being determined to lose weight, multiple benefits such as modeling contracts (and thus, money), being let into parties, being given free things by admirers, etc. could happen. Meanwhile, other posts say that this is purely on a self-esteem level, and their sense of confidence and selfhood entirely depends on how beautiful they are.
However, other waifs can be misanthropic, with them believing that most people in general are beneath them or undesirable as friends or romantic partners. The personal issues referenced in niche memes also relates to lacking friends or boyfriends (the aesthetic is highly cishet). Depression, personality disorders, and general toxicity would ward off traditional relationships with healthy individuals. This is why another term for this aesthetic is ""femcel."" Many memes and whispers reference being chronically online, hating conversation, etc. This makes them share traits with many male incels.
Interestingly, many waifs are not actually femcels, but rather do it because it is a phrase that shocks and provokes, creating an edge that contrasts the traditionally feminine aesthetic.[6] Also note that this aesthetic is not to be confused with other aesthetics that use the term femcel, such as Femcel Weeaboo, or people who simply self-identify as femcels, who would not look through and engage with the community through an aesthetic lens.
As previously mentioned, gaining wealth and admiration is a common goal amongst these young women, and multiple memes and manifestation videos show their desire to be more intelligent. Despite partying and doing drugs having a strong emphasis, literature and prep schools are romanticized as a way to cope with the stress of school and being a high-achiever. Like in Dark Academia, pretentiousness is celebrated, and works of media considered prestigious (Dostoevsky, Sylvia Plath, etc.) and philosophy (French existentialism especially) are used to relate to their experience and a conversation topic rather than drudgery that other teenagers may believe. Many posts involve snippets of philosophical thoughts super-imposed over images. Rumination over relations of the self to others, gaining desire for the will to live, and thoughts over concepts introduced by philosophers and auteurs are common, including concepts of the erotic grotesque, the myth of Sisyphus, etc.
The emphasis on intellectualism also connects to Waifs' fascination with the esoteric, specifically with Catholicism. People in this community often relate to female saints in that they both are considered strange and unable to fit in with the people not being in the group. Femcels' lack of human connection can combine with the intellectualism and inner turmoil that relates to saints' lack of normal connections with other people. These Waifs often claim to receive divine messages and connect it with ""delusions"" or being ""delusional."" Nuns and saints being ascetic also connects to this community's emphasis on anorexia, which is a mental illness that can be caused by the desire to be ""pure"", including separation from food.
This leads into the community's common association with mental illness and personality disorders. All of the works listed in the media section feature protagonists who have issues of neuroticism and mental disorders (psychopathy in American Psycho, psychosis and hyper-perfectionism in Black Swan, depression in The Bell Jar, etc.) and the bloggers often express these characters' relatability to themselves. Often, they would aspire to be like one of these characters, as despite their personality flaws and poor relationships, the characters live picturesque lives filled with monetary success, beautiful lifestyles, drama, and occasionally, hope for recovery. This makes them cross over with the ""literally me"" film bros in that the viewer connects their lack of satisfaction in life with a similar character going through a heightened version of their struggle. There is also a romanticization of lobotomies, overlapping with Lobotomy Chic.
Embracing and advertising negative and toxic traits in this community is part of a larger trend online, especially with TikTok[7] and Whisper, an anonymous secret-sharing app. Discussing flaws such as being narcissistic, dishonest, unstable, etc. is a demonstration of authenticity and contrasts more mainstream ideas of toxic positivity, mental wellness, and being normal. This also has a gendered interpretation; traditionally, women are encouraged to be kind and outwardly focused. Openly displaying ""unlikable"" personality traits can be connected to the greater increase of media written by women who wish to portray the realities of individuals, rather than a feminine ideal. Many of the works discussing this theme are included in the media list below.
This led to the community's sympathy for women deemed insane and/or cruel. Two figures discussed in this community are Amy Dunne and Jodi Arias, who both killed their romantic partners, albeit Amy Dunne is a fictional character from Gone Girl by Gillian Flynn while Jodi Arias is a real criminal. The women in this community often claim that these women were justified in carrying out their crimes because of the slights they experienced in their lives.
However, the persona of a femcel girlblogger is also steeped in irony. The community acknowledges its chronically online and mentally ill demographic that clashes with the imagery of the successful models and actresses in its imagery. A large part of the aesthetic's appeal is the contrast between traditional feminine image of rich girls being happy with sadness and toxicity, which are typically considered ""ugly"".
The aesthetic also includes multiple self-awareness in memes and text posts, with direct references to the concepts of personae, the hyperreal, the male gaze, etc., which would be known because of the aforementioned interest in philosophy.
The images featured in this aesthetic are often edited to be more washed out through using a pale gray filter.
Images of glamorous types of people are one of the most common photo subjects. These are women who carry across the energy of this aesthetic in that they are beautiful but have an unapproachable and cold aura about them. Thin, with either blasé or cheeky expressions, and unglamorous clothing are their common qualities. Supermodels, often Naomi Campbell, Devon Aoki, the Hadid sisters, Anya Taylor Joy, Kate Moss, and Lily Rose Depp in candid photos with unprofessional lighting and grimy environments are popular.
Fashion images are the next most popular subject. Runway details, designer storefronts, shopping bags, and cosmetics showcase the beauty of these girls and the aspirational lifestyle they have.
Another important visual is that of bedrooms, as an introverted teenaged girl would spend her time there most often. These bedroom photos have a range of looks. Some are messy and chaotic to the point of disfunction, which is modeled off of Dasha Nekrasova, the more popular host of The Red Scare podcast, who has a New York apartment with clothes on every surface and only a mattress in the center. Meanwhile some are sparse to the point of asceticism, with only white as the color. Often, this includes a single cross on the wall. Another bedroom archetype relates more towards the hyper-feminine, Dollette-leaning bloggers, with large amounts of pink girly objects such as candles, ornate bed frames, and fluffy pillows, which may be similar to Shabby Chic.
Ballet is another important visual, specifically those of ballet academies in Russia. Rather than images of performances with full costumes, however, these images always take place during class or independent practice. The colors associated with class uniforms and the setting: black, off-white, pale pink, and gray, fit the color palette. Images of ""what's in my bag"" for ballet students are also popular; pointed shoes, iPods, towels, magazines, etc. arranged haphazardly are common.
Building off from above, Russian/Slavic culture is frequently referenced in fashion (fur hats), literary tastes, whispers expressing the desire to move to the nation, and of course a fascination with the Slavic Dolls of the 2000s. The stereotypical image of a Russian woman: conventionally attractive, thin, pale, blonde-haired, and blue-eyed and the fact that Dasha Nekrasova is from Belarus would contribute to this admiration.
There are frequent references to having cigarettes and black or iced coffee, which are substitutes for food that have connotations associated with sophistication. Likewise, canned Diet Coke is another common photo subject and a reference to anorexics. Schnapps and vodka, especially cherry-flavored, refer to the Lana Del Rey song ""This is What Makes Us Girls"", Russia fixation, and party lifestyle that these girls strive for.
Catholic and Catholic school imagery is also popular. Schoolgirls in uniform, nuns, Bibles, and rosaries often appear as visuals. In Whispers and text posts, these young women regularly joke about their Catholic upbringing, such as the religious trauma they experienced and the inside jokes that comes with living through similar life experiences. Catholic motifs in fashion have become popular in late 2021-early 2022 alternative fashion, with irony and sincerity being blurred.[8] The religious imagery is often sacreligous and ironic, contrasted between overt sexuality, drugs, and partying and even sometimes going to full on Catholic Horror, similar to in Morute.
Similarly, prep school in general is often referenced. Images of Rory Gilmore and other fictional characters or celebrities in school uniforms reading and holding books of high literary merit are common. Literature is celebrated, with books by Sylvia Plath, Dostoevsky, and the Brontë sisters appearing in memes and bookshelf images. There is a lot of overlap in this area with Coquette Academia.
Another motif often used are prey animals, particularly fawns or lambs. They are often a representation of innocence and cuteness, but also have a motif of fragility and vulnerability. The importance of ""doe eyes"" in looks also contributes to this link[9].
An example of an edit done to make it look like an article from The Cut, which uses this distinctive title font and quip-y subtitles.
Edited screenshots of news articles from the digital magazines Vulture and The Cut are common, where, instead of a fashion/cultural title, the magazine would ""report"" on the mundane activities of a ""girlblogger"" (a young woman who is chronically online), or a model.
There are also multiple variations on the aesthetic, with users leaving out certain elements or adding images with Preppy, Pink Parisian, Morute, Downtown Girl, Babygirl, Messy French It Girl, and Vintage Americana aesthetics. The constant between all Waif bloggers is their admiration for models and the shared language and memes.
For the purposes of citation and examples, see the Wayback Machine archive of the Tumblr tag.
One of the main modes of conveying this aesthetic are Whispers, which are from an app of the same name. In them, users have to overlay a confession over an image. Waifs use imagery that matches the aesthetic, and text that communicates the typical thoughts relating to the characteristics of a waif. Word salads are fairly common, and describe the aesthetic in an overwhelming, chaotic way that mimics some prose of authors that these women read.
Slogans and a shared vocabulary are also incredibly repeated in this community. Some of them include:
Memes are an incredibly common way to link these aesthetic visuals together and create a community. One format that is incredibly popular is the ""I would go to school if..."" meme where ""if this were the teacher"" is captioned under an image of a model, ""if this was the uniform"" under the fashion with the aesthetic, ""if this was the lunch"" under Diet Coke and cigarettes, etc.
Another common meme is the ""Are ya winning, daughter?"" format edited with PNGs of the visuals, garments, albums, and books associated with the community surrounding a simple drawing of a crying or smiling girl and her father checking in on her.
Waifs also create crowded collages with overlayed text saying some variation of ""if this is her vibe, RUN."" A similar text overlay is ""This is me, if you even care,"" put over an image of a beautiful character, deer, etc., which represents a Waif's desire for attention for her claimed good looks.
The ""You are the average of the five people you spend the most time with. The five people in question:"" template overlays the quote above and different outlines of five people with pngs of the above visuals.
Another meme is ""boys' pockets versus girls' pockets,"" where under the boy's pockets are standard objects such as keys and a phone, while the girl has Waif-related objects.
Many Waif photos are also pictures of models with text over them that is meant to represent an experience the Waif has with her personality.
Another way waifs participate in the aesthetic is through comment/tag games where an image with different waif-related categories of media and visuals (books, albums, beverages, types of skirts, etc.) are in rows with numbers, letters, and symbols above each item. A user then puts the symbols of what they would pick from each category in the comments.
Many women also put an illustration of the insectoid protagonist Greogor Samsa in Franz Kafka's Metamorphosis as a representative of themselves in memes, representing the alienation he feels after transforming from a normal man into a pest. An alternative is the Wojak edit, which is a meme (often with pessimistic and even sexist connotations). The famous Wojak of the tradwife, with the blonde hair and blue floral dress, often represents Waifs. Alternatively, a Waif may take the base female Wojak and edit it to her preference.
Outfit moodboards and object collections link the different components of the aesthetic together. The outfit is often accompanied by transparents of coffee, newspaper headlines, cigarettes and other drugs, and books.
The fashion featured in this aesthetic largely originates from the hyper-feminine luxury fashion of the 2000s McBling aesthetic, the original Dark Nymphet aesthetic, and current trends in the early 2020s such as Coquette and Balletcore, and the clothing of the characters a Waif desires to be (i.e. ballet dancer, private school student).
The styling can range from being prim and polished to messy and disorganized, similar to how the Waif community includes women who can be perfectionists or depressed and unable to be motivated.
Skinniness is an aspect that is emphasized in fashion. One of the ways this is done is through wearing Brandy Melville, a brand known for having ""one-size-fits-all"" that is actually for extremely petite women. Wearing such clothing is a status symbol representing the wearer's ability to wear the small clothes. The garments in the fashion based on 2000s trends, such as low-rise jeans and baby tees, are deliberately skimpy to emphasize the fact that the wearer could do so without being perceived as ""unflattering.""[10]
A common motif that is on multiple items is the use of screenprinting Waif visuals onto clothes, particularly baby tees. The businesses doing this are often independent small businesses on Depop or Instagram.
The media that is considered ""Waif"" comes from the various edits, whispers, text posts, and images that these young women post. As such, what is considered part of the Waif ""canon"" comes from the frequency of these works being mentioned.
As previously discussed, the commonality between these works is the motif of mental illness or disordered personalities. Because of this, most of the works here are in the psychological drama genre. Often, the protagonists of these stories are overtly feminine and in relatively privileged positions in life while suffering from their mental illness or ruining their mundane life. For example, The Bell Jar and Black Swan have a fashion magazine intern and a ballet dancer as protagonists, respectively.
Aesthetically, these works may or may not resemble Waif visually. For example, there are many references to the Joker, a comic book villain, in memes, but the movies he is in clashes with the aesthetic. On the other hand, many works also become more known for the aesthetic than for the motifs. Marie Antoinette, for example, is more light-hearted than the other movies featured but the hyper-feminine visuals make Waifs put it in the backgrounds of Whsipers.
The music associated with the aesthetic originates mostly from Pale Grunge 2014 Tumblr.
One of the most commonly referenced things in Whispers is being in a bedroom, either relaxing with Lana del Rey music and social media, or having poor mental health. This is often called ""rotting.""
As previously discussed, reading literature and philosophy and watching films are a large component of the aesthetic.
In contrast, the images on these blogs often show smoking, drugs, and reference parties in songs, implying that this sort of lifestyle is desired. Note that this is all said online, meaning that a lot of these party and drug references are not necessarily true, and these young women could be making confessions for the sake of gaining popularity and exploring fantasy, rather than actually living out the lifestyle of a ""waifspo"" character.
New Age spirituality/teen girl pseudoscience is popular in this community, specifically with ""manifesting"", where people focus their thoughts to bring money, beauty, success, etc. into reality. This can also be brought on by listening to ""subliminals"", which are videos of montages set to music that would supposedly implant subliminal messages into the brain and bring about whatever the video's purpose is. Some common subliminal video topics include becoming skinnier, richer, and having an enhanced confidence.
""toxic"" femininity- what's up with girlbloggers, female manipulators, and femcels?
A video critiquing the waif/femcel community
Of course, the largest and most obvious criticism of Waif is the encouragement of eating disorders. In creating a clique where a BMI below the healthy amount is encouraged and starving oneself is celebrated, young women may begin to develop anorexic behaviors in order to fit into the in-group.
These images also trigger those who are currently in the process of overcoming eating disorders.[11] As the aesthetic becomes more popular online, people who are in danger of relapsing may do so because of the constant reminders of anorexia.
Many people, especially Tumblr veterans, simply find this community annoying. Because their posts are formulaic and use consistent visuals and meme formats, they quickly become repetitive. This is especially true when Waifs use an abundance of tags that are unrelated to the photo. For example, tagging Vladimir Nabokov in an image of supermodels.
In addition, fans of the music and films that are labelled as being in the Waif aesthetic dislike this community because these young women misinterpret these works to the detriment of the actual artist's intent and the perception of the fans of the artist. Many of the works the Waifs admire have the theme that these negative personality traits should be overcame, criticize society, or were born out of the creator's own grief and personal struggle. People emulating the characters means that they do not truly understand the work or use critical thought in reading/watching/listening.
The performative nature of the aesthetic, especially about negative traits such as narcissism and manipulativeness is also mocked. As the image below says, constantly claiming that one has these negative traits is ""cringe"" in that a person who is genuinely manipulative, intelligent, etc. would not want to or have to brag about it online.",2020,,"Mental illness, drug addiction, glamour","Black, pink, beige, white, red",
Warmcore,https://aesthetics.fandom.com/wiki/Warmcore,"Warmcore is an aesthetic that is related to Cottagecore, Naturecore and other nature/farm-related aesthetics. The aesthetic related to things at make a person feel warm and fuzzy inside, with a hint of nostalgia. Warmcore aesthetics usually warm, bright lighting over a usually nature centered aesthetic. Its nostalgic quality can come from visuals just blurred or warm enough to feel slightly like happy memories.
The aesthetic is especially springy or summery, with bits of early fall.
Warmcore exhibits a wide array of warm colors, notably marigold orange, golden yellows, cream, tan, white, and light greens. Photos use these colors as well as blurred or warm-tinted filters to create the nostalgic, warm feeling present in the aesthetic.
Nature plays a great part in Warmcore. Wide, open fields, flower gardens, forests, and hilled plains are common settings. Sunshine and bright, direct light areas also contribute to the warm of warmcore.
Warmcore fashion consists of flowy dresses, floral prints, blouses, comfy and, obviously, warm clothes. Summery outfits fit into this aesthetic as well. Fashion inspiration is similar to Cottagecore and Grandparentcore.
The activities relating to Warmcore all connect to having fun and feeling happy and nostalgic. ",2010s,,"Finding a sort of elegant, soft beauty in nature","Soft/pale yellows, warm white, very light greys

Weirdcore,https://aesthetics.fandom.com/wiki/Weirdcore,"Weirdcore is a surrealistic aesthetic centered around amateur or low-quality photography and/or visual images that have been constructed or edited to convey feelings of confusion, disorientation, dread, alienation and nostalgia or anemoia.
Visually, it is strongly influenced by the general look and feel of images shared on an older internet, roughly a period spanning from around the late 90's to mid 2000's. Amateur editing, primitive digital graphics, lo-fi photography and image compression are some of the most common elements found in Weirdcore images.
Thematically, Weirdcore often conveys a feeling of dread, brought forth by its low-quality imagery and a lack of context in regard to the location or the message being shown. This does not mean that Weirdcore is deeply rooted in horror, however, as the feeling of fear left on the viewer is merely a side effect of placing them in an unfamiliar setting or context. This is purely subjective however, and depends on the viewer, their own experiences and the content of an edit; while some people might find a Weirdcore image scary or ominous, others might feel nostalgia or even a feeling of comfort.
Amateur, blurry or Lo-Fi photography is one of the most common elements in Weirdcore. These are often Liminal Spaces, an aesthetic that Weirdcore has a strong connection to and often relies on, but the use of them is not obligatory. The virtual part of an image often (but not always) manifests itself in the form of plain-looking text which conveys a message that is incomplete or out of context, thus leaving the viewer to ask questions and make their own interpretations in regard to the meaning of the statement presented to them (keep in mind that text is not a necessary part of Weirdcore).
It is important to know, however, that both of these ""portions"" of Weirdcore do not need to be present simultaneously to make a good image; for example, a Weirdcore image may be constructed exclusively out of virtual elements and could still be categorized as such. The same applies to amateur/lo-fi photography, but regardless of how the process of creating Weirdcore is approached, the images should still aim to put the viewer in an unfamiliar, confusing, and occasionally somewhat hostile context.
Currently, the exact origins of Weirdcore are unknown, but they may go as far back as the early 2010s. It has recently been determined that the earliest Weirdcore edit with a confirmed date of creation was made in 2016, but there could be earlier examples out there that remain unknown.
The genre started to pick up popularity when a YouTuber by the name of DavidCrypt uploaded a video explaining the Weirdcore aesthetic. Whilst there are popular Weirdcore creators, it is often hard to find the most popular or the origins of the content and creators, as most current Weirdcore content is uploaded to Tumblr, which doesn't show follower counts, as well as numerous reposts.","Late 1990's-mid-2000's, mostly around mid-2020

Wholesome Meme,https://aesthetics.fandom.com/wiki/Wholesome_Meme,"Wholesome Meme is a meme aesthetic based around wholesomeness, love, positivity and happiness. The aesthetic typically consists of cute or funny pre-existing images edited with a massive amount of hearts and overlayed positive and heartwarming phrases, thus, it creates a sense of comfort and joy. The images edited often feature cute fictional characters (such as Kirby, Kermit the Frog, characters from We Bare Bears, etc.), anime characters, Internet memes (such as Doge), cute animals, YouTubers and other well known celebrities. Sometimes pessimistic images are also taken and they are given a different, sympathetic meaning. Wholesome Memes were mainly prevalent in 2018 and 2019, especially within some Instagram and Musical.ly trends such as edits featuring the song Mine by Bazzi.

XO,https://aesthetics.fandom.com/wiki/XO,"XO is the aesthetic surrounding The Weeknd's early musical projects (House of Balloons, Thursday, EchoesOfSilence). It incorporates themes of late 2000s parties and the darker aspects of it, with elements of heavy drug usage, sex, manipulation, detachment, and depression. It is not meant to romanticize these topics, but to show the effects it can have on a person's sanity and morals.
The most recurring visuals are balloons, drugs, liminal spaces, and depressed women. Usually accompanied by messy amateurish dark black and white edits and the Helvetica Bold font. It heavily relies on taking things normally associated with fun and twisting them into something darker.
This dark and lowkey aesthetic is what The Weeknd's early music heavily relied on, imagery wise. However the musical content is the main focus, which talked about elements of depression and manipulation. The main character appears extremely detached from the world around them, not caring about how their actions affect them and others surrounding them. Production is very rough and minimalistic with heavy use of electrical guitars and simplistic melodies.","Late 2000s/Early 2010s

Xpiritualism,https://aesthetics.fandom.com/wiki/Xpiritualism,"Xpiritualism is a loosely defined term for a diverse internet outsider art movement focusing on digital collage. This art form combines elements of Old Web culture, esotericism, New Age spirituality, and foreign internet aesthetics. The hashtag ""#Xpiritualism"" was coined by 3rd.world.elite on Instagram. On TikTok, Xpiritualist edits often share common, repetitive elements. However, in other more niche spaces like Instagram, Discord, and YouTube, innovation, the combination of techniques, and unique art styles are highly encouraged. This movement is defined by three main concepts: spirituality, old net art, and world culture. It is not a rigidly defined style, which is why it appeals to its outsider art fanbase.
Xpiritualism uses distorted and surreal images, similar to Weirdcore. Both have roots in early net art and use kitschy, cheap-looking effects. But Xpiritualism mixes in different art styles and ideas. It often uses themes of spirituality, old internet culture, ancient art, and things from many different cultures. This is different from Weirdcore, which usually has a simpler and more homogeneous look. Visually and musically, the most closely related aesthetic is HexD.
There are a few common misunderstandings about Xpiritualism:
Xpiritualism is more than just an aesthetic or style. It is a circle of artists who support each other and make art with similar themes. They like to experiment and try new things. The aesthetic became known as ""Yabujincore"" or ""CurseWeb"" on TikTok, but these names are frowned upon by the fanbase because they are artists and using such names could undermine other people in the movement. Some people don't even want it to have a name, because they think that might limit it. But for now, ""Xpiritualism"" is the preferred name.
Yabujin is a notable artist in Xpiritualism, often credited with its popularization, but he was not the first to make art and music like this. Various other net artists such as horribleluxury, Elysia Crampton, Thaiboy Digital, Do Thi Thien Ly Live Beautifully, James Howard, FlorecitaDreams, and Sam Hyde (Million Dollar Extreme) were already making edits like this and exploring similar ideas. Xpiritualism is about creating new things, not just copying what's already been done. It's about using the internet and art to explore ideas about spirituality, multiculturalism, and internet culture.
This is a category for anything that could inspire new styles within the movement.",,,"Multiculturalism, dark humor, bizarre/surreal imagery, low quality JPEGs, old net, outsider digital collage
